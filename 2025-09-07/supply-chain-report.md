Ikegami et al. developed an approach to reveal squid fossils, focusing on their beaks, the sole hard component of their bodies. They found that squids radiated rapidly after shedding their shells, reaching high levels of diversity by 100 million years ago. This finding shows both that squid body forms led to early success and that their radiation was not due to the end-Cretaceous extinction event...
