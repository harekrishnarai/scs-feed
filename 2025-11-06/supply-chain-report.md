### 2. Show HN: Ito AI, open source smart dictation

**Link:** [https://ito.ai](https://ito.ai)

**Published:** 11/6/2025

**Summary:** Hey HN, I’m Evan, cofounder and CTO of Ito AI. Ito is a voice to intent app that turns what you say into structured text: notes, messages, code, or any text field you’re working in. It’s designed to feel fast, clean, and distraction free. It works on Windows and Mac. Most speech tools are either locked inside closed systems or overly complicated & overly parameterized and difficult to setup. We wanted something that works like a native app, looks good, and stays transparent about your data. Ito is open-source under GPL-3. Our focus is simplicity and polish. You can use a few different models and providers but we're still working on an entirely local first experience. It's also pretty easy to host yourself if you want to avoid our infra all together. We’re still early, but it’s already stable enough that I use it daily for coding notes, writing, and quick thoughts between tasks. Try it here: https://ito.ai Code: https://github.com/heyito/ito Would love feedback, critiques, and ideas for integrations.
