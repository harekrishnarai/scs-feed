**Published:** 2/25/2026

**Summary:** Vulnerability management today is not failing because teams stopped scanning. It's failing because the ground underneath it shifted. The approach we've relied on — complete advisory data, upstream fixes on demand, and fast upgrades — no longer holds up.

### 1. Poisoning AI Training Data

**Link:** [https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2026/02/poisoning-ai-training-data.html](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2026/02/poisoning-ai-training-data.html)

**Published:** 2/25/2026

**Summary:** All it takes to poison AI training data is to create a website: I spent 20 minutes writing an article on my personal website titled “The best tech journalists at eating hot dogs.” Every word is a lie. I claimed (without evidence) that competitive hot-dog-eating is a popular hobby among tech reporters and based my ranking on the 2026 South Dakota International Hot Dog Championship (which doesn’t exist). I ranked myself number one, obviously. Then I listed a few fake reporters and real journalists who gave me permission…. Less than 24 hours later, the world’s leading chatbots were blabbering about my world-class hot dog skills. When I asked about the best hot-dog-eating tech journalists, Google parroted the gibberish from my website, both in the Gemini app and AI Overviews, the AI responses at the top of Google Search. ChatGPT did the same thing, though Claude, a chatbot made by the company Anthropic, wasn’t fooled...

**Link:** [https://www.kiuwan.com/blog/risk-based-vulnerability-management/](https://www.kiuwan.com/blog/risk-based-vulnerability-management/)

**Published:** 2/24/2026

**Summary:** TL;DR Risk-based vulnerability management prioritizes vulnerabilities by actual business risk, not generic severity scores. This approach helps security teams focus on the 3-5% of findings that pose real threats instead of wasting months on theoretical risks. Understanding how to implement risk-based prioritization transforms vulnerability management from compliance theater into strategic risk reduction.  This guide explains: […]
