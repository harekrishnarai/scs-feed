### 1. Security Vulnerabilities in ICEBlock

**Link:** [https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/07/security-vulnerabilities-in-iceblock.html](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/07/security-vulnerabilities-in-iceblock.html)

**Published:** 7/17/2025

**Summary:** The ICEBlock tool has vulnerabilities: The developer of ICEBlock, an iOS app for anonymously reporting sightings of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials, promises that it ‚Äúensures user privacy by storing no personal data.‚Äù But that claim has come under scrutiny. ICEBlock creator Joshua Aaron has been accused of making false promises regarding user anonymity and privacy, being ‚Äúmisguided‚Äù about the privacy offered by iOS, and of being an Apple fanboy. The issue isn‚Äôt what ICEBlock stores. It‚Äôs about what it could accidentally reveal through its tight integration with iOS...

### 2. Hacking Trains

**Link:** [https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/07/hacking-trains.html](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/07/hacking-trains.html)

**Published:** 7/16/2025

**Summary:** Seems like an old system system that predates any care about security: The flaw has to do with the protocol used in a train system known as the End-of-Train and Head-of-Train. A Flashing Rear End Device (FRED), also known as an End-of-Train (EOT) device, is attached to the back of a train and sends data via radio signals to a corresponding device in the locomotive called the Head-of-Train (HOT). Commands can also be sent to the FRED to apply the brakes at the rear of the train. These devices were first installed in the 1980s as a replacement for caboose cars, and unfortunately, they lack encryption and authentication protocols. Instead, the current system uses data packets sent between the front and back of a train that include a simple BCH checksum to detect errors or interference. But now, the CISA is warning that someone using a software-defined radio could potentially send fake data packets and interfere with train operations...
