### 1. Bloat in software is getting WAAAY out of hand

**Published:** 12/27/2025

**Summary:** I saw a Sudoku game the other day-SUDOKU you know a few numbers-that took 40 seconds to load, and then caused the phone to overheat while in play, while splashing ads here and there. Its sad. That was the very definition to me of "giving into bloat". Nobody cares about efficiency anymore, and in fact are going in the opposite direction. Substituting bloat for actual programming knowledge, many of these game developers never touched a single ounce of code nor would know how to begin with. Just downloaded some bloaty API and pump out games on an engine that requires 4TB to run (so basically it means spoiled brats are using it) I have given up on computer science which I used to love so much. Anymore its just...disappointing how the world adapted to it. very...very disappointing. All that potential yet it is all wasted on bloat, redundant security and moneygrubbing before the first pixel is ever drawn.

### 1. Friday Squid Blogging: Squid Camouflage

**Published:** 12/26/2025

**Summary:** New research: Abstract: Coleoid cephalopods have the most elaborate camouflage system in the animal kingdom. This enables them to hide from or deceive both predators and prey. Most studies have focused on benthic species of octopus and cuttlefish, while studies on squid focused mainly on the chromatophore system for communication. Camouflage adaptations to the substrate while moving has been recently described in the semi-pelagic oval squid (Sepioteuthis lessoniana). Our current study focuses on the same squid’s complex camouflage to substrate in a stationary, motionless position. We observed disruptive, uniform, and mottled chromatic body patterns, and we identified a threshold of contrast between dark and light chromatic components that simplifies the identification of disruptive chromatic body pattern. We found that arm postural components are related to the squid position in the environment, either sitting directly on the substrate or hovering just few centimeters above the substrate. Several of these context-dependent body patterns have not yet been observed in ...
