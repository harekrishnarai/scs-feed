### 2. Show HN: Built Needfind to find my first customers – now dogfooding it on itself

**Link:** [https://needfind.app](https://needfind.app)

**Published:** 1/2/2026

**Summary:** After launching a few apps (most recently Wreckruiter - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46457269), I realized something: anyone can build. The hard part is getting customers. I'd spend weeks building, launch on Product Hunt, get some upvotes... then crickets. Meanwhile, real potential customers were out there on Reddit and HN literally asking "is there a tool that does X?" – and I had no idea. So I built Needfind (https://needfind.app). Paste your product URL, and it searches Reddit and Hacker News for people who need what you built. It finds:   - High-intent posts ("looking for a tool that...")   - Pain point discussions (people complaining about the problem you solve)   - Competitor complaints ("I wish [competitor] would...") The fun part: I'm now using Needfind to find customers for Needfind itself. Eating my own dogfood, GitHub-style. The community angle: Building alone is hard. So there's a community directory where founders can list their products and help each other. Upvote products you like, leave tips on finding customers. Founders helping founders. Would love feedback from HN. What signals do you look for when finding early customers? Any subreddits or sources I should add?

### 3. Show HN: A Triton windowing test with ray tracing and GUI

**Link:** [https://github.com/mehmetoguzderin/triton-windowing](https://github.com/mehmetoguzderin/triton-windowing)

**Published:** 1/2/2026

**Summary:** I've been recently testing GPU kernel dev with Triton; however, I couldn't find a graphics sample that combines an update loop with windowing, mouse-keyboard interactivity, etc., so I decided to give it a shot with single-sphere ray tracing and ImGui. Unfortunately, I couldn't get to zero-shot copy with CUDA & WSLg (since I am running on WSL2), so it defaults to a host copy for framebuffer unless you enable the WIP flag. Any feedback or contributions for a zero-copy pipeline (whether running on a Linux box with OpenGL & CUDA on the same device, or some shortcut for CUDA and WSLg) are always welcome! Any Triton optimization tips & tricks would also be appreciated. I found certain utilities like autotune for kernels to be quite interesting, and computer graphics application could make things and advantages more visual.

### 1. Flock Exposes Its AI-Enabled Surveillance Cameras

**Link:** [https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2026/01/flock-exposes-its-ai-enabled-surveillance-cameras.html](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2026/01/flock-exposes-its-ai-enabled-surveillance-cameras.html)

**Published:** 1/2/2026

**Summary:** 404 Media has the story: Unlike many of Flock’s cameras, which are designed to capture license plates as people drive by, Flock’s Condor cameras are pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras designed to record and track people, not vehicles. Condor cameras can be set to automatically zoom in on people’s faces as they walk through a parking lot, down a public street, or play on a playground, or they can be controlled manually, according to marketing material on Flock’s website. We watched Condor cameras zoom in on a woman walking her dog on a bike path in suburban Atlanta; a camera followed a man walking through a Macy’s parking lot in Bakersfield; surveil children swinging on a swingset at a playground; and film high-res video of people sitting at a stoplight in traffic. In one case, we were able to watch a man rollerblade down Brookhaven, Georgia’s Peachtree Creek Greenway bike path. The Flock camera zoomed in on him and tracked him as he rolled past. Minutes later, he showed up on another exposed camera livestream further down the bike path. The camera’s resolution was good enough that we were able to see that, when he stopped beneath one of the cameras, he was watching rollerblading videos on his phone...

### 1. 2026: Trust Is the Currency, Platforms Are the Standard, and Vendors Must Justify Their Seat at the Table

**Published:** 1/1/2026

**Summary:** Listen to a Notebook LLM podcast version of the blog: Your browser does not support the audio element. First things first Those who know me know that I don’t publish predictions just because the calendar flips, and for a few years, I’ve avoided posting blogs, forecasts, and year-end summaries. But 2025 was different. Not because …
