### 1. Show HN: I wrote an embeddable Unicode algorithms library in C

**Published:** 1/11/2026

**Summary:** Hello everyone. One year ago I released Unicorn (an embeddable Unicode algorithms library) under a source available license. Today I'm re-releasing it under the GNU General Public License (version 3) for its one year anniversary. My hope is the GPL expands the project's user base to non-profits and Free Software enthusiasts. I think the more folks using it only benefits the project. The proprietary license will continue to be available for businesses that can't comply with the GPL. Thanks for checking it out!
