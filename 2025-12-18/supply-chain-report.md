**Published:** 12/17/2025

**Summary:** For two days in September, Afghanistan had no internet. No satellite failed; no cable was cut. This was a deliberate outage, mandated by the Taliban government. It followed a more localized shutdown two weeks prior, reportedly instituted “to prevent immoral activities.” No additional explanation was given. The timing couldn’t have been worse: communities still reeling from a major earthquake lost emergency communications, flights were grounded, and banking was interrupted. Afghanistan’s blackout is part of a wider pattern. Just since the end of September, there were also major nationwide internet shutdowns in ...

### 1. 2025 Federal Retrospective: The Year of Resilient Innovation

**Link:** [https://www.sonatype.com/blog/2025-federal-retrospective-the-year-of-resilient-innovation](https://www.sonatype.com/blog/2025-federal-retrospective-the-year-of-resilient-innovation)

**Published:** 12/18/2025

**Summary:** Resiliency has been top of mind in 2025, and recent high-profile CVEs serve as holiday reminders that adversaries aren't slowing down. But what changed this year was how the federal community responded. Increasingly, exploitability drove the clock: when vulnerabilities surfaced as actively exploited, agencies leaned on a more operational posture where "Are we exposed?" and "How fast can we fix it?" mattered as much as "How severe is it?" In that environment, 2025 was defined by a single, powerful transition: the shift from planning modernization to executing it at scale. For years, agencies have discussed digital transformation, zero trust, and the promise of AI. This year, those themes moved from strategy decks into day-to-day delivery.
