**Published:** 8/26/2025

**Summary:** I wrote about this in 2023. Hereâ€™s the story: Three Dutch security analysts discovered the vulnerabilitiesÂ­â€”five in totalâ€”Â­in a European radio standard called TETRA (Terrestrial Trunked Radio), which is used in radios made by Motorola, Damm, Hytera, and others. The standard has been used in radios since the â€™90s, but the flaws remained unknown because encryption algorithms used in TETRA were kept secret until now.   Thereâ€™s new news: In 2023, Carlo Meijer, Wouter Bokslag, and Jos Wetzels of security firm Midnight Blue, based in the Netherlands, discovered vulnerabilities in encryption algorithms that are part of a European radio standard created by ETSI called TETRA (Terrestrial Trunked Radio), which has been baked into radio systems made by Motorola, Damm, Sepura, and others since the â€™90s. The flaws remained unknown publicly until their disclosure, because ETSI refused for decades to let anyone examine the proprietary algorithms...
