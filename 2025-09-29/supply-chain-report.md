### 1. Show HN: Open-Source Configurable AI Agents for Company Research

**Link:** [https://github.com/DimiMikadze/Mira](https://github.com/DimiMikadze/Mira)

**Published:** 9/29/2025

**Summary:** Hi HN, I'm Dimi. Last month I released Mira, an open-source system for company data enrichment. It automates the process of gathering and structuring information about companies, which is something I found myself doing over and over again for sales, investment, and market research workflows. How it works You define an agent — a workflow that specifies: - what data points you want (e.g. funding, industry, hiring signals) - which sources to query (website crawling, LinkedIn, Google Search) - and optional evaluation criteria (e.g. "raised Series A in last 12 months") Mira then runs specialized agents: - Website Explore finds relevant subpages beyond the homepage (/press for news, /careers for hiring, etc.) - LinkedIn agent pulls structured data and recent posts - Search agent generates targeted queries and extracts details from results - Analysis Agent evaluates companies against your custom criteria and produces a fit score with reasoning The findings are merged into a profile where every field has a confidence score and source attribution. If all data points are found with high confidence, the run stops early to save compute. What's new since the initial release - Configurable agents (you define workflows instead of hardcoded ones), - Bulk processing of lists of companies, - Evaluation via criteria + fit scoring, - Outreach drafting (LinkedIn + email drafts) based on the  research results. Mira has been used for: - Mapping markets and researching competitors - Filtering startup lists into targeted shortlists - Enriching and automating CRMs - Drafting outreach personalized with research It's built with TypeScript and the OpenAI Agents SDK, MIT licensed, and comes with a Next.js app that shows the research process step by step.

**Summary:** Notion just released version 3.0, complete with AI agents. Because the system contains Simon Willson’s lethal trifecta, it’s vulnerable to data theft though prompt injection. First, the trifecta: The lethal trifecta of capabilities is: Access to your private data—one of the most common purposes of tools in the first place! Exposure to untrusted content—any mechanism by which text (or images) controlled by a malicious attacker could become available to your LLM The ability to externally communicate in a way that could be used to steal your data (I often call this “exfiltration” but I’m not confident that term is widely understood.)...
