### 3. Tell HN: Amazon has deactivated my seller account. No idea how to move forward

**Link:** [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46709409](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46709409)

**Published:** 1/21/2026

**Summary:** I sell 3d printed sleeves to attach an Apple Airtag to a Samsung TV remote. But Amazon thinks I am selling a Samsung device and has deactivated me for IP violations.  My listings are very clear that this is FOR a Samsung device, and not an actual Samsung device. But Amazon's automated system can't figure it out. I am following their IP guidelines for compatible products (section 6C - https://sellercentral.amazon.com/help/hub/reference/GZUQ6GBBXQVHQKF2): You can see one of my listings here: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FHZVVL1H Every time I listed a new product for a different TV remote, my item would be flagged, but then I would go in and make a small edit, and that seemed to trigger some sort of review, and everything would be great. Until last week, out of nowhere, my account has been deactivated. To reinstate my account, they asked me to submit an authorization letter from the manufacturer or brand owner authorizing me to sell their products. Well, I figured, I am the manufacturer, so I wrote an authorization letter for myself, and even got it notarized for good measure, that I am legally allowed to sell these devices. But to no avail. I have an option to "Submit new information." But have no new information to submit, and fear if I try submitting anything else, I'll be permanently banned or something. The funny part is that on most of the products I have listed, I am losing money, just because of the FBA costs and the advertising costs. I lost about $250 last month between two of the variants. The sad part is that I sell a book, Computer Engineering for Babies, and do most all my sales through my website, but do get a few orders a week through amazon for the book, and am now afraid the Amazon door is closed forever.

**Published:** 1/21/2026

**Summary:** No matter how many times we say it, the idea comes back again and again. Hopefully, this letter will hold back the tide for at least a while longer. Executive summary: Scientists have understood for many years that internet voting is insecure and that there is no known or foreseeable technology that can make it secure.  Still, vendors of internet voting keep claiming that, somehow, their new system is different, or the insecurity doesn’t matter.  Bradley Tusk and his Mobile Voting Foundation keep touting internet voting to journalists and election administrators; this whole effort is misleading and dangerous...
