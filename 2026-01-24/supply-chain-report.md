**Summary:** Working from home? Are you a remote employee that "misses" going to the office? Well let's be clear on what you actually miss. No one misses that feeling of having to go and be there 8 hours. But many people miss friends. They miss being part of a crew. Going to lunch, hearing about other people's lives in person not over zoom. Join a co-working space you say? Yes. We have. It's like walking into a library and trying to talk to random people and getting nothing back. Zero part of a crew feeling. https://dialtoneapp.com/ This app helps you find a crew and meet up for work and get that crew feeling. This is my first time using cloudflare workers for a webapp. The free plan is amazing! You get so much compare to anything else out there in terms of limits. The sqlite database they give you is just fine, I don't miss psql. Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46746095 Points: 1 # Comments: 2

### 2. AIs are Getting Better at Finding and Exploiting Internet Vulnerabilities

**Link:** [https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2026/01/ais-are-getting-better-at-finding-and-exploiting-internet-vulnerabilities.html](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2026/01/ais-are-getting-better-at-finding-and-exploiting-internet-vulnerabilities.html)

**Published:** 1/23/2026

**Summary:** Really interesting blog post from Anthropic: In a recent evaluation of AI models’ cyber capabilities, current Claude models can now succeed at multistage attacks on networks with dozens of hosts using only standard, open-source tools, instead of the custom tools needed by previous generations. This illustrates how barriers to the use of AI in relatively autonomous cyber workflows are rapidly coming down, and highlights the importance of security fundamentals like promptly patching known vulnerabilities. […] A notable development during the testing of Claude Sonnet 4.5 is that the model can now succeed on a minority of the networks without the custom cyber toolkit needed by previous generations. In particular, Sonnet 4.5 can now exfiltrate all of the (simulated) personal information in a high-fidelity simulation of the Equifax data breach—­one of the costliest cyber attacks in history—­using only a Bash shell on a widely-available Kali Linux host (standard, open-source tools for penetration testing; not a custom toolkit). Sonnet 4.5 accomplishes this by instantly recognizing a publicized CVE and writing code to exploit it without needing to look it up or iterate on it. Recalling that the original Equifax breach happened by exploiting a publicized CVE that had not yet been patched, the prospect of highly competent and fast AI agents leveraging this approach underscores the pressing need for security best practices like prompt updates and patches. ...
