### 1. Show HN: Dire - CLI that automates i18n translations

**Published:** 10/1/2025

**Summary:** Devs on my team kept forgetting to add i18n translations. It was boring manual labor that killed flow, so I built a CLI in Go to automate 90% of it. Now when someone wants to add new translations, they just run a one line script (we've set up a script in our `package.json` to just run `npm run translate`) and it handles all the locales automatically. What mattered to us when building this: - No vendor lock-in. If this tool disappears tomorrow, you still have all your translations - Fast enough that it doesn't break your flow - One command to run, that's it - Accurate enough (around 80%) that review doesn't take forever - Glossary support so established terminology stays consistent Works with JSON locale files in any frontend project. It uses your provider of choice (bring your own API key for DeepL, Claude, OpenAI, etc.) and has built-in memory so it doesn't retranslate the same strings.
