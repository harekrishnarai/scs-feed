### 1. OrthoRay – A native, lightweight DICOM viewer written in Rust/wgpu by a surgeon

**Published:** 2/9/2026

**Summary:** Hi HN, I am an orthopedic surgeon and a self-taught developer. I built OrthoRay because I was frustrated with the lag in standard medical imaging software. Most existing solutions were either bloated Electron apps or expensive cloud subscriptions. I wanted something instant, local-first, and privacy-focused. So, I spent my nights learning Rust, heavily utilizing AI coding assistants to navigate the steep learning curve and the borrow checker. This project is a testament to how domain experts can build performant native software with AI support. I built this viewer using Tauri and wgpu for rendering. Key Features: Native Performance: Opens 500MB+ MRI series instantly (No Electron, no web wrappers). GPU-Accelerated: Custom wgpu pipeline for 3D Volume Rendering and MPR. BoneFidelity: A custom algorithm I developed specifically for high-fidelity bone visualization. Privacy: Local-first, runs offline, no cloud uploads. It is currently available on the Microsoft Store as a free hobby project. Disclaimer: This is intended for academic/research use and is NOT FDA/CE certified for clinical diagnosis. I am evaluating open-source licensing options to make this a community tool. I’d love your feedback on the rendering performance.

### 1. LLMs are Getting a Lot Better and Faster at Finding and Exploiting Zero-Days

**Link:** [https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2026/02/llms-are-getting-a-lot-better-and-faster-at-finding-and-exploiting-zero-days.html](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2026/02/llms-are-getting-a-lot-better-and-faster-at-finding-and-exploiting-zero-days.html)

**Published:** 2/9/2026

**Summary:** This is amazing: Opus 4.6 is notably better at finding high-severity vulnerabilities than previous models and a sign of how quickly things are moving. Security teams have been automating vulnerability discovery for years, investing heavily in fuzzing infrastructure and custom harnesses to find bugs at scale. But what stood out in early testing is how quickly Opus 4.6 found vulnerabilities out of the box without task-specific tooling, custom scaffolding, or specialized prompting. Even more interesting is how it found them. Fuzzers work by throwing massive amounts of random inputs at code to see what breaks. Opus 4.6 reads and reasons about code the way a human researcher would­—looking at past fixes to find similar bugs that weren’t addressed, spotting patterns that tend to cause problems, or understanding a piece of logic well enough to know exactly what input would break it. When we pointed Opus 4.6 at some of the most well-tested codebases (projects that have had fuzzers running against them for years, ...
