### 1. ResearchPod – Turn ArXiv papers into 20-min podcast episodes (iOS)

**Link:** [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46502745](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46502745)

**Published:** 1/5/2026

**Summary:** Hi HN, I’m Noah and I built ResearchPod because I was drowning in arXiv PDFs but had a 45 minute commute where my brain was free but my eyes were busy. ResearchPod transforms any research paper (via PDF upload or arXiv browse) into a podcast episode that's about 20 minutes long and features two hosts. How it works: 1. Extraction: It parses the PDF and cleans the text. 2. Analysis/Scripting: It uses OpenAI and Grok to extract key insights and reformat them into a natural dialogue between two hosts, Alex and Sam. They don't just read the text. Instead, they discuss the methodology and implications like peers. 3. Synthesis: The script is sent to a dedicated TTS service running Gemini 2.5-flash-preview. I'm using the multi-speaker features to give each host a distinct and natural voice. Why I built this:  I found that triage is the hardest part of research. I don't always have time to sit and read 30 pages just to find out if a paper is relevant to my interests. Listening to a high-fidelity summary while I’m at the gym or commuting helps me decide which papers deserve a deep dive later. Tech Stack: App: Swift (iOS 16+) Backend: Node.js on Vercel Database: Supabase TTS: Railway (handling the long-duration audio generation) The app is currently free to use. You can generate up to 3 episodes per day for free and you can listen to as many as you want. I'm really looking for feedback from the research community here. Does this bridge the gap for you or is the conversational format too "lite" for your workflow? App Store: https://apps.apple.com/de/app/researchpod/id6751007088?l=en-GB Web Share (to hear an example): https://researchpod-share.vercel.app/episode/84435c8e-b691-4f58-82bd-f09a6e281d11 Would love to hear your thoughts!

**Published:** 1/5/2026

**Summary:** Hello, today im sharing readingnotes.ai with our community to get some feedback. I built readingnotes.ai to solve my own problem of saving too many articles and research papers to read later but never getting back to it. So, now i have 1000s of bookmarks in X (twitter), Linkedin, Bookmarks, Whatsapp and Apple Notes. What i built - > dead simple way to save url, text or files via web or whatsapp or email > create 3 levels of depth summary > ai assistant to maintain memory of saved material and my questions & answers around saved content, mental models etc > content studio to generate social media posts and podcasts based on my content library  > mcp connector, slack & telegram integration > custom email for your to let readingnotes read the newsletters you subscribe to Would love to onboard 10-20 folks who read a lot or struggle with going through bookmarked lnks to give it try and share their feedback. thank you. link to the site: readingnotes.ai Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46502722 Points: 1 # Comments: 0

### 3. Show HN: HackTheNews – iOS 26 Liquid Glass Hacker News Client with AI Summaries

**Link:** [https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hack-the-news-ai-hn-reader/id6447095897](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hack-the-news-ai-hn-reader/id6447095897)

**Published:** 1/5/2026

**Summary:** Hey HN! I've been maintaining HackTheNews (a native iOS client for Hacker News) for a while now, and with iOS 26 dropping its new "Liquid Glass" design language, I couldn't resist doing a full visual overhaul. What's new: - Complete redesign using iOS 26's Liquid Glass materials - Translucent, layered UI that adapts to your wallpaper - New glass-style navigation and tab bars - Refined typography and spacing for the new aesthetic Implementation notes for fellow iOS devs: - Used the new `.glassEffect()` modifiers throughout - Had to rethink some hierarchy decisions – Liquid Glass works best with    fewer nested containers The before/after difference is pretty striking. Happy to share more technical details if anyone's curious about adopting Liquid Glass in their own apps. Would love to hear your feedback – especially from fellow HN readers on what features you'd like to see next. Always open to suggestions!
