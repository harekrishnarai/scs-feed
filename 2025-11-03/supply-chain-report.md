### 1. Show HN: Word Wolfer, Number Wolfer – educational games inspired by Munchers

**Link:** [https://memalign.github.io/m/wolfer/index.html](https://memalign.github.io/m/wolfer/index.html)

**Published:** 11/3/2025

**Summary:** Hi HN! I just shipped a handful of educational games playable in your web browser. I hope you will give them a try and consider sharing them with the students in your life. I labeled each game with the target grade level (from TK up through middle school, and even high school for Spanish). I've wanted to bring this style of educational game back to life for a long time. In the early 90s, my grandmother had a Macintosh with educational games. She was a teacher who specialized in teaching reading. She showed me how to play Word Munchers and I had a blast munching words with the right vowel sounds. Wolfers games should look good on phones, iPads, and can also be installed as progressive web apps on your home screen. I recently found a simpler way to make PWAs thanks to this minimal-pwa[0] project (via HN). I made this a bit more dynamic and self-contained in Wolfer's pwa.js and added offline PWA support in sw.js. I go as far as to dynamically generate the icon for each game variant using JavaScript. I didn’t realize browsers supported this! I shared more development details and links to the source code here[1]. 0: https://github.com/chr15m/minimal-pwa 1: http://memalign.github.io/p/wolfers.html Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45802499 Points: 1 # Comments: 0

**Published:** 11/3/2025

**Summary:** Security Operations Centers (SOC) today are overwhelmed. Analysts handle thousands of alerts every day, spending much time chasing false positives and adjusting detection rules reactively. SOCs often lack the environmental context and relevant threat intelligence needed to quickly verify which alerts are truly malicious. As a result, analysts spend excessive time manually triaging alerts, the

**Published:** 11/3/2025

**Summary:** These days, the most important meeting attendee isn’t a person: It’s the AI notetaker. This system assigns action items and determines the importance of what is said. If it becomes necessary to revisit the facts of the meeting, its summary is treated as impartial evidence. But clever meeting attendees can manipulate this system’s record by speaking more to what the underlying AI weights for summarization and importance than to their colleagues. As a result, you can expect some meeting attendees to use language more likely to be captured in summaries, timing their interventions strategically, repeating key points, and employing formulaic phrasing that AI models are more likely to pick up on. Welcome to the world of AI summarization optimization (AISO)...
