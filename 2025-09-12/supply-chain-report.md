### 1. Show HN: Project Chimera v1.2 – Neuro-Symbolic-Causal AI Agent (Open Source)

**Link:** [https://github.com/akarlaraytu/Project-Chimera](https://github.com/akarlaraytu/Project-Chimera)

**Published:** 9/12/2025

**Summary:** I’ve just released Project Chimera v1.2, an open-source hybrid AI agent that blends neuro-symbolic reasoning with causal inference to tackle strategic decision-making problems. Benchmarks: I tested my Neuro+Symbolic+Causal Agent against LLM-Only agent and LLM+Symbolic agent. The full neuro-symbolic-causal agent outperformed all baselines. * In brand-trust mode, it hit 1.000 trust and $2M profit, 43% ahead of the nearest rival. What’s new in v1.2: * Trust-Adjusted Profit Metric → balances short-term profit with long-term brand trust. * Dynamic Strategic Personality → adapts its internal priorities based on the mission goal. * Mandatory Rule Validation → ensures all hypotheses align with business constraints. * Performance Boost → causal engine now initializes once per simulation (much faster). * Multi-Scenario Benchmarking → run brand-trust, profit-maximizing, and balanced strategies in one command. * Expanded Metrics + Live Strategy Feed → more meaningful KPIs and real-time decision logs. GitHub: https://github.com/akarlaraytu/Project-Chimera Live Demo: https://project-chimera.streamlit.app/ I’d love your feedback, questions, or ideas for new benchmarks. Contributions are welcome!
