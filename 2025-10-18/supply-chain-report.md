### 1. Show HN: Open-Source Finance Agent

**Link:** [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45629371](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45629371)

**Published:** 10/18/2025

**Summary:** Hey guys, I’m open sourcing an autonomous financial research and analysis agent. The agent can search SEC filings, extract key financials, and build financial models. It’s scored 80% on the public Finance Agent validation set with GPT-5, compared to the top result of 55% listed on their website for their private validation set. But, their public validation set has mistakes. There are quite a few cases where the “ground truth” answers in the benchmark are wrong. I’ve documented each case with citations directly to SEC Edgar here (https://github.com/lucasastorian/intellifin-agent/blob/main/...) Accuracy with GPT-5 jumps to 92% once we fix those mistakes in the eval. You can clone the repo and rerun the benchmark yourself. Next step should be turning this into an open-source “Cursor for Finance,” with a proper UI for equities research and financial modeling. Feedback & questions are welcome. https://github.com/lucasastorian/intellifin-agent Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45629371 Points: 1 # Comments: 0
