### 1. Show HN: We Built a Small LLM Comparison Page and Accidentally a Platform

**Link:** [https://www.fallom.com/](https://www.fallom.com/)

**Published:** 12/1/2025

**Summary:** My cofounder and I built a quick site comparing LLMs. It was basically “what model is good at what.” It was fun and useful, and a fun side project. But feedback pushed us into A/B testing models in production. So we built Fallom (homage to Asimov), a platform where you can compare how multiple models perform on your own evals or production data. You can easily see cost and performance differences and know if it’s worth switching models. Would love feedback from anyone who’s built internal model testing pipelines. We learned a lot the hard way and are still learning. Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46111150 Points: 1 # Comments: 0

### 4. Ask HN: Do you believe aliens are visiting Earth?

**Link:** [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46111119](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46111119)

**Published:** 12/1/2025

**Summary:** So there's nuance here. Let's define "Aliens" as "non human sentiences". Personally, I think ET hypothesis is valid. Maybe you feel UT (ultra-terrestrial) hypothesis makes more sesne. Or "ED" ( extra-dimensional, as opposed to "from another planet/galaxy"). Facts: there's abundance of testimony that would secure conviction in court regarding abductions, encounters (of variosu "kinds"), and "multi-sensor data". Truth is, it goes back centuries, before we could concievably have "RE'd" (reverse-engineered) anything similar. So there has to be something external to our current human civilization (not so surprising, how can you explain how megalithic 100-ton bricks structures were build by "primitives"). Yes, this is "provocative" (perhaps) for some on HN. That's the point. not adversarial, but simply to "provoke" a thought - rather, a question - "what is" the nature of reality? The existence of a "higher"/superior/more technological sentient intelligence interacting with us and our planet is a natural pairing with that question. Belief is important. Because, your personal experience constitutes, for others, a belief. And that's much of the "evidence" we have. Trend seems clear in gestalt: disclsoure is coming. So I ask here to take the pulse of this "intellectual/technical/curious/secular" (corase categroties) community. Do you believe this is real? If so, why? If not, why not? If we were to get "DISCLOSURE" (ie, the "government authroity" of a "respect country" stating unequivocally that the reality of "alien" contact is true) woudl your ontology/worldview be "shattered" or "robust", or "otehr"? *why so many "airquotes"? I recognize the plurality of meanings and layers of baggage associated with different terms. THe air-quotes are simply a glib nod to such multiplicity. Take as such, s'il vous plais. Basically this post is to serve as a historical marker for taking the temperature of a significant collective in the "pre-disclosure" era. So this is your chance to record your official viewpoint, before it all comes down. What you say? I am very interested.

**Published:** 12/1/2025

**Summary:** Hackers aren’t kicking down the door anymore. They just use the same tools we use every day — code packages, cloud accounts, email, chat, phones, and “trusted” partners — and turn them against us. One bad download can leak your keys. One weak vendor can expose many customers at once. One guest invite, one link on a phone, one bug in a common tool, and suddenly your mail, chats, repos, and

**Published:** 12/1/2025

**Summary:** The AI browser wars are coming to a desktop near you, and you need to start worrying about their security challenges. For the last two decades, whether you used Chrome, Edge, or Firefox, the fundamental paradigm remained the same: a passive window through which a human user viewed and interacted with the internet.

### 1. Banning VPNs

**Link:** [https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/12/banning-vpns.html](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/12/banning-vpns.html)

**Published:** 12/1/2025

**Summary:** This is crazy. Lawmakers in several US states are contemplating banning VPNs, because…think of the children! As of this writing, Wisconsin lawmakers are escalating their war on privacy by targeting VPNs in the name of “protecting children” in A.B. 105/S.B. 130. It’s an age verification bill that requires all websites distributing material that could conceivably be deemed “sexual content” to both implement an age verification system and also to block the access of users connected via VPN. The bill seeks to broadly expand the definition of materials that are “harmful to minors” beyond the type of speech that states can prohibit minors from accessing­ potentially encompassing things like depictions and discussions of human anatomy, sexuality, and reproduction...
