### 2. Show HN: Interactive timeline of US Military bases and interventions, 1900–today

**Link:** [https://metaphorician.com/american-empire](https://metaphorician.com/american-empire)

**Published:** 1/17/2026

**Summary:** Built with D3 and canvas. Uses CShapes data from ETH Zürich for historically accurate country borders that shift as you play through the timeline. Military base data from David Vine's research, interventions from Congressional Research Service reports, among many other sources. You can toggle categories, zoom to regions, and hover for details. Click to pin tooltips. If you find anything missing or misleading, I'd love to hear it, so I can improve the accuracy.

### 3. Show HN: Upseated – Swap airplane seats with other passengers

**Link:** [https://upseated.com/](https://upseated.com/)

**Published:** 1/17/2026

**Summary:** Hey HN, We built Upseated to solve a problem every traveler knows: you check in and discover you're stuck in a middle seat, or you're rows away from your kids, or you're right next to the lavatory in a non-reclining seat. Airlines let you pick seats during booking, but once you're assigned, you're basically stuck. We created a P2P marketplace where passengers can swap seats with each other—either upgrade to a better spot by paying another passenger, or monetize your own seat if someone wants it more than you do. How it works: Enter your flight info and seat assignment Browse swap opportunities from other passengers on your flight Negotiate directly through the app Complete payment via Stripe Board with your original ticket, swap seats once on the plane Technical details: Native iOS and Android apps + web platform (upseated.com) Real-time matching algorithms to connect compatible swap partners Stripe Connect for secure P2P payments All swaps backed by contract law for user protection Works with all airlines (no partnerships needed) Why this works legally: Airlines prohibit transferring tickets/boarding passes, but there's no regulation against seat swaps once you're boarded. The ticket gets you on the plane—where you sit is negotiable. Use cases we're seeing: Parents separated from kids during booking Business travelers who need aisle seats for laptop work Budget flyers monetizing exit row seats they don't value Anyone who booked late and got stuck with terrible seats We're live on iOS, Android, and web. Would love feedback from the HN community—especially around UX, security considerations, and potential edge cases we should handle. Happy to answer any questions!

### 4. Automation Isn't Innovation

**Link:** [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46660455](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46660455)

**Published:** 1/17/2026

**Summary:** I have an IQ in the range of 130 to 135, tested while having ADHD and without medication. I do not believe that CEOs have low IQ. However, lately, things no longer seem to make sense to me. Business is all about marketing and yelping their products. But technology works differently. Innovation in technology has historically grown at a superlinear rate. Web technology, for example, is not new, yet it never stagnated after its creation. Instead, it continuously evolved. On the frontend, we saw the emergence of increasingly powerful libraries and frameworks, from Angular to React to Next.js. The same pattern applies to backend systems, tooling, and infrastructure. In artificial intelligence, the current state of the art models are Transformers. At their core, they predict the next token based on previous tokens. The pipeline is simple in principle: data is collected, a model is trained, and the result is a system that predicts patterns extremely well. AI, however, does not create innovation. What it excels at is automation. Current architectures are nowhere near AGI. In fact, no one even agrees on what AGI truly is, and these architectures will never reach it. What the industry is doing instead is scaling model size aggressively, which is an inefficient and unsustainable approach rather than a fundamentally new idea. If you are a software engineer at a company rewriting the same CRUD code repeatedly, then yes, you are at risk of being replaced by AI. I have seen many excellent developers who can truly build systems and write real software, not just solve Leetcode problems. Big tech companies have massive funding and have produced tremendous innovation over the years. I do not understand why the narrative has shifted to saying that developers are no longer needed or that AI can replace them. AI combined with software engineers should open more doors for innovation, not fewer. Instead of growth, companies are focused on shrinking. Ironically, software engineers should be the last group to be replaced, because they are the ones who build and integrate automation. Replacing them first is a fundamental mistake. I am writing this because almost no one talks about these issues openly, but everyone yelping about Claude Code. If Claude is really that good, why did they choose to acquire Bun for one billion dollars instead of hiring senior developers to build it themselves?

**Summary:** More than a decade after Aaron Swartz’s death, the United States is still living inside the contradiction that destroyed him. Swartz believed that knowledge, especially publicly funded knowledge, should be freely accessible. Acting on that, he downloaded thousands of academic articles from the JSTOR archive with the intention of making them publicly available. For this, the federal government charged him with a felony and threatened decades in prison. After two years of prosecutorial pressure, Swartz died by suicide on Jan. 11, 2013. The still-unresolved questions raised by his case have resurfaced in today’s debates over artificial intelligence, copyright and the ultimate control of knowledge...
