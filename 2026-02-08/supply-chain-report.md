**Published:** 2/8/2026

**Summary:** I switched from Linux to macOS a while ago and there are two things I still miss:   Launching apps with parameters. On Linux you edit a .desktop file and that's it — VS Code opening a   project folder, a script, whatever. On macOS there's no simple way to do this. Automator and Shortcuts   feel overcomplicated for something so basic, and the paid launchers do way more than I need.    Alt+Tab showing windows, not apps. Cmd+Tab groups everything by application. If I have several Chrome or    VS Code windows open, I can't pick which one I want.    So I vibecoded this. It does two things:    - Cmd+Shift+Space opens a grid of configurable launchers. Each one runs a shell command — open an app, a    URL, a script, with whatever arguments.   - Option+Tab shows every window individually, like Alt+Tab on Linux.    It's a native Swift app, JSON config, no dependencies. Free and open source.   Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46936845 Points: 1 # Comments: 0
