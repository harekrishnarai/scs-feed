### 1. Show HN: Plugboard – a Python framework for modelling complex processes

**Link:** [https://github.com/plugboard-dev/plugboard](https://github.com/plugboard-dev/plugboard)

**Published:** 10/14/2025

**Summary:** I've recently open-sourced Plugboard - a Python framework for modelling complex processes. We originally started out helping data scientists to build models of industrial processes where there are lots of stateful, interconnected components. Example usage could be a digital twin of a mining process, or a simulation of multiple steps in a factory production line. Do please give it a try if you've faced the challenges of running complex, data-intensive simulations in Python, and let us know what you think!
