**Published:** 10/30/2025

**Summary:** Interesting article about the arms race between AI systems that invent/design new biological pathogens, and AI systems that detect them before they’re created: The team started with a basic test: use AI tools to design variants of the toxin ricin, then test them against the software that is used to screen DNA orders. The results of the test suggested there was a risk of dangerous protein variants slipping past existing screening software, so the situation was treated like the equivalent of a zero-day vulnerability. […] Details of that original test are ...
