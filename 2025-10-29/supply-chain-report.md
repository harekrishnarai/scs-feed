### 3. Show HN: Lucent Chat – Create videos and images with Veo, Sora, etc. in one chat

**Link:** [https://lucentchat.com](https://lucentchat.com)

**Published:** 10/29/2025

**Summary:** Hey HN, We built Lucent Chat because creating with AI has become a mess. You'd ask ChatGPT for a prompt, copy it into another tool, tweak settings, open three tabs, run into token limits, and lose your style halfway through. Iteration was slow, context vanished, and the process killed the creative flow. Lucent Chat is our attempt to fix that - a single chat where you can generate, refine, and manage all your visuals and videos across Veo, Sora, Kling, Seedream, Nano Banana, and more. You describe what you want and Lucent handles the rest. It will find the right model, optimise your prompt + parameters behind the scenes. Once you do generate something, it's dead simple to keep on going and iterate off it with remixing. You can also get inspiration from what others are creating. We started this out of frustration with how fragmented creative AI had become, and now we're releasing it to the world. We're giving out free credits (40 images or 4 videos with Sora 2) to early adopters from HN! You can try it here: https://lucentchat.com?utm_source=hn Feedback is hugely appreciated.

### 1. Signal’s Post-Quantum Cryptographic Implementation

**Link:** [https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/10/signals-post-quantum-cryptographic-implementation.html](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/10/signals-post-quantum-cryptographic-implementation.html)

**Published:** 10/29/2025

**Summary:** Signal has just rolled out its quantum-safe cryptographic implementation. Ars Technica has a really good article with details: Ultimately, the architects settled on a creative solution. Rather than bolt KEM onto the existing double ratchet, they allowed it to remain more or less the same as it had been. Then they used the new quantum-safe ratchet to implement a parallel secure messaging system. Now, when the protocol encrypts a message, it sources encryption keys from both the classic Double Ratchet and the new ratchet. It then mixes the two keys together (using a cryptographic key derivation function) to get a new encryption key that has all of the security of the classical Double Ratchet but now has quantum security, too...

**Published:** 10/28/2025

**Summary:** Good Wall Street Journal article on criminal gangs that scam people out of their credit card information: Your highway toll payment is now past due, one text warns. You have U.S. Postal Service fees to pay, another threatens. You owe the New York City Department of Finance for unpaid traffic violations. The texts are ploys to get unsuspecting victims to fork over their credit-card details. The gangs behind the scams take advantage of this information to buy iPhones, gift cards, clothing and cosmetics. Criminal organizations operating out of China, which investigators blame for the toll and postage messages, have used them to make more than $1 billion over the last three years, according to the Department of Homeland Security...

### 1. Aisuru Botnet Shifts from DDoS to Residential Proxies

**Link:** [https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/aisuru-botnet-shifts-from-ddos-to-residential-proxies/](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/aisuru-botnet-shifts-from-ddos-to-residential-proxies/)

**Published:** 10/29/2025

**Summary:** Aisuru, the botnet responsible for a series of record-smashing distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks this year, recently was overhauled to support a more low-key, lucrative and sustainable business: Renting hundreds of thousands of infected Internet of Things (IoT) devices to proxy services that help cybercriminals anonymize their traffic. Experts says a glut of proxies from Aisuru and other sources is fueling large-scale data harvesting efforts tied to various artificial intelligence (AI) projects, helping content scrapers evade detection by routing their traffic through residential connections that appear to be regular Internet users.
