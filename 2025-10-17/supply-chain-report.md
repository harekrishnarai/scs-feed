**Published:** 10/17/2025

**Summary:** I'm not posting this to advance a political agenda, but more because with recent protests, Chenoweth's text is getting more mentions recently.  Agree or disagree, people around me are definitely talking about it.  Mostly talking about the 3.5% of the population figure that if they're on the streets in protest, it's an indicator that the establishment is on shaky political grounds. Here's the WorldCat reference: https://search.worldcat.org/title/660804982 Anyway... just passing it along since I figured it might be interesting to a non-zero percentage of the people here. Also... someone posted this related TEDx video several years ago.  Adding it as well in case you can't get to your local library: https://cinemaphile.com/watch?v=YJSehRlU34w And if you like to buy books, here's the Amazon link: https://www.amazon.com/dp/0231156839/ And the intarwebs archive has it available for people with print disabilities: https://archive.org/details/whycivilresistan0000chen_f8y4 Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45620145 Points: 1 # Comments: 0

### 4. Show HN: I made a daily language guessing game

**Link:** [https://raymondtana.github.io/projects/pages/Langr.html](https://raymondtana.github.io/projects/pages/Langr.html)

**Published:** 10/17/2025

**Summary:** "Langr" is a language guessing game, similar to other Wordle variants, and is unique for its multimodality. The game provides a sample of a given language of the day, revealing more clues about that sample as the game goes on:     Audio -> Phonetic -> English -> Family -> Written  The inspiration came after one-too-many-times of hearing a random language on the street and not being able to confirm what it was... Spoken samples, sentence text, and other speaker metadata are sourced from the open-source Mozilla CommonVoice. Language metadata was mainly sourced from Glottolog, including a language's family lineage. Phonetic transcriptions are generated using eSpeak. English translations needed to be generated by Google Translate. The langcodes library helps to translate between each library using standard ISO 639‑3 codes. Hope you enjoy! Feel free to try out today's game as well as some from the previous few months. Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45619994 Points: 1 # Comments: 0
