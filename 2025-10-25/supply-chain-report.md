### 2. Show HN: Alexandrie – A open source Markdown note-taking app I built as student

**Published:** 10/25/2025

**Summary:** Hi HN, Over the past few years, I’ve been working on a personal project called Alexandrie, a web-based Markdown note-taking app that started as a tool I built for myself while in engineering school. I wanted something fast, offline-friendly, and minimal, without the heaviness of tools like Notion or Obsidian — but still with enough structure and features for everyday note-taking and writing. After a lot of iterations, I’ve just released version 8.0.0, which includes major improvements to the documentation, Docker setup, and overall performance. Key features: Extended Markdown syntax (snippets, instant formatting, keyboard shortcuts) Offline-first (works even without a connection) Categories, workspaces, and sub-doc organization Simple Go backend + Vue/Nuxt 3 frontend Fully open source under MIT license Why I’m sharing this I’m not launching a product — this is more of a community project that I’d love to keep improving with other developers. I really enjoy discussing ideas, reviewing PRs, and getting feedback from people who use or hack on similar tools. If that sounds interesting, you can check out the repo here:  https://github.com/Smaug6739/Alexandrie There’s also a hosted demo version you can try directly in your browser. Any feedback, ideas, or suggestions are very welcome! Thanks for reading Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45705840 Points: 1 # Comments: 0
