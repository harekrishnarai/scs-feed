### 1. Ask HN: Will humans still vote after AI takes over?

**Link:** [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46695890](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46695890)

**Published:** 1/20/2026

**Summary:** Taxpayer money has always been central to democracy, as it allows citizens to decide how public funds are used. But if AI and robots take over most labor and taxes are no longer needed, it makes me question: will human votes still matter? Or will those who own the AI and robots become the new decision-makers a.k.a voters, since they control the resources once funded by taxes? Without taxes or meaningful employment, people's role in governance might become irrelevant. Is that where we are headed?

### 2. Show HN: Paradigm – Interactive Visualizer for Codebases

**Link:** [https://useparadigm.app/](https://useparadigm.app/)

**Published:** 1/20/2026

**Summary:** Hi HN — we built Paradigm: a tool that turns a Python repo into an interactive visualization where you can click any node/edge and jump straight to the exact source. It generates: - Call graphs (what calls what) - Module dependency graphs - “Processes”: end-to-end execution paths inferred from the call graph, from entrypoints (functions/methods with no callers) down to leaf calls (e.g. cli.main → pipeline.run → loader.load → db.fetch) Why we built it: With AI-assisted coding it’s easy to lose your mental model of how things work. When an agent makes a large change, you still need to understand what it actually did. Paradigm keeps the architecture visible and tied to the source. Would love feedback.
