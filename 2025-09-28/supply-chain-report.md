**Summary:** Just release this app using Vibe Coding, it took me 2 weeks from idea to release in store, 1 week for building, 1 week to fix 3 apple review rejections. Here is what I learn: 1, I didn't write single line of code, Cursor+Xcode handle 90% of the work, but I still need to fix some weird issues and bugs myself. 2, You don't need revenueCat or Adapty for in app purchase, apple's new store kit2 handle all the cases including server side receipt validation, I didn't even use cocoapods which make things faster 3, Your main role is product manager that test each new features AI added, so remember to use many git push and branches to save work 4, Building the app is easy now, but the harder part is marketing and how to grow it into real business, which I am still learning 5, I got the app name from AI, even the main ICON is generated by AI, but I did spent $240 on upwork for App Store marketing design 6, sometime the cursor can't fix a compiler issue, I copy paste the code to chatgpt for 2nd opinion which is working. Here is the app link, feel free to check out: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pinmapper/id6752612645 Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45406580 Points: 1 # Comments: 0
