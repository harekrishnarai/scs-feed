### 1. Assessing the Quality of Dried Squid

**Link:** [https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/09/assessing-the-quality-of-dried-squid.html](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/09/assessing-the-quality-of-dried-squid.html)

**Published:** 9/12/2025

**Summary:** Research: Nondestructive detection of multiple dried squid qualities by hyperspectral imaging combined with 1D-KAN-CNN Abstract: Given that dried squid is a highly regarded marine product in Oriental countries, the global food industry requires a swift and noninvasive quality assessment of this product. The current study therefore uses visible­near-infrared (VIS-NIR) hyperspectral imaging and deep learning (DL) methodologies. We acquired and preprocessed VIS-NIR (400­1000 nm) hyperspectral reflectance images of 93 dried squid samples. Important wavelengths were selected using competitive adaptive reweighted sampling, principal component analysis, and the successive projections algorithm. Based on a Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN), we introduce a one-dimensional, KAN convolutional neural network (1D-KAN-CNN) for nondestructive measurements of fat, protein, and total volatile basic nitrogen…...

### 2. A Cyberattack Victim Notification Framework

**Link:** [https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/09/a-cyberattack-victim-notification-framework.html](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/09/a-cyberattack-victim-notification-framework.html)

**Published:** 9/12/2025

**Summary:** Interesting analysis: When cyber incidents occur, victims should be notified in a timely manner so they have the opportunity to assess and remediate any harm. However, providing notifications has proven a challenge across industry. When making notifications, companies often do not know the true identity of victims and may only have a single email address through which to provide the notification. Victims often do not trust these notifications, as cyber criminals often use the pretext of an account compromise as a phishing lure. […] This report explores the challenges associated with developing the native-notification concept and lays out a roadmap for overcoming them. It also examines other opportunities for more narrow changes that could both increase the likelihood that victims will both receive and trust notifications and be able to access support resources...
