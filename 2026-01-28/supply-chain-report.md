### 3. Show HN: Free On-Device AI SDK to Run PyTorch on Mobile NPUs (Open Source)

**Link:** [https://github.com/zetic-ai/ZETIC_MLange_apps](https://github.com/zetic-ai/ZETIC_MLange_apps)

**Published:** 1/28/2026

**Summary:** Hello HN, I’m Yeonseok, CEO of ZETIC.ai (ex-Qualcomm AI Research). Deploying AI models to mobile NPUs usually requires deep hardware knowledge and months of tuning. Today, we are changing that. We are opening our On-device AI SDK for free right now. We’ve released a GitHub repository that gives you direct access to full NPU acceleration on heterogeneous devices (Android/iOS). You don't need GPU Cloud infrastructure anymore. What you can do with this SDK (GitHub):  Full NPU Speed: We unlock raw NPU power for heterogeneous devices globally. No more CPU lag.  Bring Your Own Model: Don't just run our demos. You can upload your custom model and get an optimized, hardware-accelerated SDK in hours.  Production-Ready Source Code: The repo includes full source code for On-device AI Agents, 40+ Language Translations, and SOTA Object Detection examples to get you started immediately. We want to democratize access to NPU computing. The GitHub repo is ready-to-use. I’d appreciate it if you could check the code and give it a Star if you find it useful. Repo: https://github.com/zetic-ai/ZETIC_MLange_apps Let me know if you have any questions about the NPU implementation!

### 4. Show HN: A single command to run Claude Code inside Lima VMs

**Link:** [https://github.com/sylvinus/agent-vm](https://github.com/sylvinus/agent-vm)

**Published:** 1/28/2026

**Summary:** I am very afraid to run claude (or even npm) on my host system. It is a security incident waiting to happen. To fix that but still keep the friendly developer experience of just typing a single command in the folder I want to work on, I wrote a simple script that allows one to run "claude-vm" anywhere, with the local folder mounted but a fully isolated VM. As bonuses, I added Chrome MCP, Docker, and an easy way to customize the base VM or its folder-specific runtime copy. It's not much, but it's been pretty valuable to me so I may as well share it! Feedbacks welcome. Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46799410 Points: 1 # Comments: 0

**Published:** 1/28/2026

**Summary:** When security teams discuss credential-related risk, the focus typically falls on threats such as phishing, malware, or ransomware.

**Published:** 1/27/2026

**Summary:** The US Supreme Court is considering the constitutionality of geofence warrants. The case centers on the trial of Okello Chatrie, a Virginia man who pleaded guilty to a 2019 robbery outside of Richmond and was sentenced to almost 12 years in prison for stealing $195,000 at gunpoint. Police probing the crime found security camera footage showing a man on a cell phone near the credit union that was robbed and asked Google to produce anonymized location data near the robbery site so they could determine who committed the crime. They did so, providing police with subscriber data for three people, one of whom was Chatrie. Police then searched Chatrie’s home and allegedly surfaced a gun, almost $100,000 in cash and incriminating notes...
