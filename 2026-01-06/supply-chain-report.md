### 1. Ask HN: AI tools to turn requirements into architecture,code,documentation?

**Link:** [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46516519](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46516519)

**Published:** 1/6/2026

**Summary:** I’m working on an academic project exploring how a Project Manager could collaborate with AI tools as a kind of “hybrid team” to develop software end‑to‑end. The idea is to start from a very simple input (e.g., a .txt file with a list of requirements) and use AI tools to generate the main deliverables of the software lifecycle: requirements analysis, architecture, frontend/backend code, database, testing, and documentation. I’m looking for AI tools that can cover one or several of these phases, or even a tool that automates most of the process. I plan to try Cursor, but I’d love to hear about other options and real‑world experiences. If you’ve used any AI tools, workflows, or pipelines that helped automate parts of software development, I’d really appreciate your recommendations. Thanks!

### 3. Show HN: NoUploadTools – Free Tools that don't upload your files

**Link:** [https://nouploadtools.com](https://nouploadtools.com)

**Published:** 1/6/2026

**Summary:** A growing collection of practical browser tools that never upload your files to servers. Every utility runs 100% client-side, keeping your sensitive data private on your own device.  nouploadtools.com What is NoUploadTools? Most online converters and utilities make you upload files to remote servers — meaning your documents, photos, IDs, contracts, or private notes are sent to a third party you don’t control. NoUploadTools takes a different approach: Everything runs in your browser, so your files never leave your device.  nouploadtools.com No uploads, no server processing, and no cloud storage.  nouploadtools.com Tools can even work offline once loaded.  nouploadtools.com Designed for privacy-aware users — freelancers, legal/professional workflows, students, or anyone wary of uploading sensitive data.  nouploadtools.com What Tools Are Available NoUploadTools is more than a single converter — it’s a suite of small, focused utilities all usable in the browser with zero upload: PDF & Document Tools Image → PDF Compress PDF PDF → Image Merge PDFs Remove metadata from documents … all client-side.  nouploadtools.com Text & Writing Tools Base64 Encoder/Decoder Markdown Editor Word/Character Count Text Diff Text Encryptor … all processed locally.  nouploadtools.com   Developer & Utility Tools  Hash Generator JSON Formatter Secure Password Checker File Encryptor (AES-256 in browser) … and more.  nouploadtools.com +1 Other Fun & Useful Stuff QR Code Generator Image compression & format tools Color Picker, Timer, Unit converters … again, all without uploads.  nouploadtools.com +1 Why This Matters There’s a big difference between tools that claim privacy and tools that actually process locally. With NoUploadTools: Your files never leave your machine.  nouploadtools.com There’s no server log, no retention policy, and no backend storage you have to trust.  nouploadtools.com You can do everyday conversions + utilities without worrying about third-party access.  nouploadtools.com A Quick Example If you need to merge several PDFs but don’t want to upload confidential files to a server, the Merge PDFs tool lets you: Drag & drop your files in the browser Reorder pages Merge locally Download the output — with no upload ever happening.
