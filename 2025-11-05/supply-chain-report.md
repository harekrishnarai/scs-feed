### 1. Show HN: NanaVis – Upload one image, describe the change

**Link:** [https://nanavis.com/](https://nanavis.com/)

**Published:** 11/5/2025

**Summary:** I often need a tiny edit to a single image and don’t want a full editor. So I built a tool that does exactly one thing: upload one image → type one instruction → get the edited image. No projects, no layers, no batch. Typical uses: “Change the jacket to dark blue” “Remove the coffee mug on the desk” “Replace background with plain white” “Soften the lighting a bit” Known limits: hair/glass/busy textures and very small sources can fail; one image at a time; same prompt may vary slightly. I’d love blunt feedback: your real prompts, common cases I missed, and where the flow gets in the way (upload/preview/download). Fail cases welcome.

### 2. Show HN: TRex – macOS OCR menu bar app, now with 100+ languages

**Link:** [https://github.com/amebalabs/TRex](https://github.com/amebalabs/TRex)

**Published:** 11/5/2025

**Summary:** Hi HN! I'm excited to share the latest major update to TRex, a free and open-source OCR tool for macOS. TRex lives in your menu bar and extracts text from anywhere on your screen with a simple screenshot-like capture. Think of any PDF where you can't select text, images with text, or even YouTube videos – TRex grabs that text straight to your clipboard. What's new in v1.9: Added Tesseract OCR engine alongside Apple Vision, giving you access to 100+ languages. TRex intelligently picks the best engine for your selected language. Apple Vision covers the common ones (English, Spanish, French, Chinese, etc.) while Tesseract fills in the gaps with everything from Afrikaans to Yoruba, including complex scripts like Arabic, Thai, and Cyrillic. https://github.com/amebalabs/TRex Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45826081 Points: 1 # Comments: 0

### 3. Show HN: sudocode – manage specs, tasks, and context-as-code for coding agents

**Link:** [https://github.com/sudocode-ai/sudocode](https://github.com/sudocode-ai/sudocode)

**Published:** 11/5/2025

**Summary:** sudocode is a lightweight context management system for coding agents that lives in your repo. It helps organize the chaos of human-AI collaboration by capturing user intent as durable specs and tracking agent activity as issues, all version-controlled with Git. This "context-as-code" approach reduces agent amnesia and accelerates development on long-horizon tasks. Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45826001 Points: 6 # Comments: 0
