### 4. Show HN: Startups.in: An in-development "global" startup intelligence database

**Link:** [https://startups.in](https://startups.in)

**Published:** 1/23/2026

**Summary:** Hi HN, I'm building Startups.in, a work-in-progress startup intelligence platform that aggregates global startup profiles with funding, sector, and location data in one place. It's still rough around the edges and in active development, but I wanted to share the public version for feedback. This started as a personal project because I wanted a clean, searchable dataset of startups across regions without jumping between multiple sources or dealing with noise I didn't want :). The product is still very much a work in progress, but it's in a usable state and open to feedback. What it currently does: + Browse startup profiles with funding and basic company metadata + Search and filter by industry, geography, etc. + View simple ecosystem trends No signup required to try it though you're welcome to sign-up to use watchlists etc. How I built it: It's backed by a custom crawler (for data I need) and enrichment pipeline using n8n workflows, with a lightweight web UI focused on fast querying and filtering. What I'm trying to learn from HN: + What data points would make this genuinely useful to you? + Would an API be valuable? + Does the UX get in the way of exploration? I'm actively iterating on it and happy to discuss further. Thanks. Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46735801 Points: 3 # Comments: 2

### 1. AIs are Getting Better at Finding and Exploiting Internet Vulnerabilities

**Link:** [https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2026/01/ais-are-getting-better-at-finding-and-exploiting-internet-vulnerabilities.html](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2026/01/ais-are-getting-better-at-finding-and-exploiting-internet-vulnerabilities.html)

**Published:** 1/23/2026

**Summary:** Really interesting blog post from Anthropic: In a recent evaluation of AI models’ cyber capabilities, current Claude models can now succeed at multistage attacks on networks with dozens of hosts using only standard, open-source tools, instead of the custom tools needed by previous generations. This illustrates how barriers to the use of AI in relatively autonomous cyber workflows are rapidly coming down, and highlights the importance of security fundamentals like promptly patching known vulnerabilities. […] A notable development during the testing of Claude Sonnet 4.5 is that the model can now succeed on a minority of the networks without the custom cyber toolkit needed by previous generations. In particular, Sonnet 4.5 can now exfiltrate all of the (simulated) personal information in a high-fidelity simulation of the Equifax data breach—­one of the costliest cyber attacks in history—­using only a Bash shell on a widely-available Kali Linux host (standard, open-source tools for penetration testing; not a custom toolkit). Sonnet 4.5 accomplishes this by instantly recognizing a publicized CVE and writing code to exploit it without needing to look it up or iterate on it. Recalling that the original Equifax breach happened by exploiting a publicized CVE that had not yet been patched, the prospect of highly competent and fast AI agents leveraging this approach underscores the pressing need for security best practices like prompt updates and patches. ...
