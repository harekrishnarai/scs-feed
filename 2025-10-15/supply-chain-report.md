### 1. Show HN: Pxxl App – A Nigerian Alternative to Vercel, Render, and Netlify

**Link:** [https://pxxl.app](https://pxxl.app)

**Published:** 10/15/2025

**Summary:** Hi HN, I built Pxxl App — a free web hosting and deployment platform for developers in Nigeria and beyond. It’s a Nigerian alternative to Vercel, Render, and Netlify, designed for those who want a simple, fast, and barrier-free way to host both frontend and backend apps. With Pxxl App, you can connect your Git repo and deploy in seconds — no credit card, no limits. You’ll get a live subdomain like yourapp.pxxl.pro, automatic builds, and continuous deployment. It supports:  • Frontend frameworks: React, Next.js, Vue, Svelte, and more  • Backend projects: Node.js, PHP, and Python  • Features like environment variables, CI/CD, and instant rollback The goal is to make cloud deployment accessible to African and global developers without the typical payment or region restrictions. It’s completely free to start, and I’d love to hear feedback from the HN community on how to improve it or what features you’d want next.
