### 2. Show HN: I built Solveig, it turns any LLM into an assistant in your terminal

**Link:** [https://github.com/FSilveiraa/solveig](https://github.com/FSilveiraa/solveig)

**Published:** 11/13/2025

**Summary:** Solveig (https://github.com/FSilveiraa/solveig) can plan tasks, read files, list directory trees, edit your code, run commands and more. Watch 45s demo: https://asciinema.org/a/p5mzDGAoHTUHNEaVeROHpFibx --- QUICK START   # Install   pip install solveig    # Run from local models or remote APIs   solveig -u "http://localhost:5001/v1" "Create a demo BlackSheep webapp"    # Mix config files and CLI args   solveig -c solveig.config -k "" -m "gpt-5"  https://github.com/FSilveiraa/solveig/blob/main/docs/usage.m... --- FEATURES AI Terminal Assistant - Automate task planning, file management, code analysis and system management using natural language in your terminal. Safe by Design - Granular controls with pattern-based permissions. File operations prioritized, and shell commands can be disabled. Plugin Architecture - Extend capabilities through drop-in plugins. Add SQL queries, web scraping or block dangerous commands with 100 lines of Python. Modern CLI - Clear interface with task planning and listing, file content previews, diff editing, API usage tracking, code linting, waiting animations and rich tree displays for informed user decisions. Provider Independence - Works with any OpenAI-compatible API, including local models. tl;dr: similar idea to Claude Code (https://claude.com/product/claude-code) or Aider (https://aider.chat/), focusing on providing explicit user consent, granular configuration, drop-in plugins and the ability to integrate any model, backend or API. See the Features for more: https://github.com/FSilveiraa/solveig/blob/main/docs/about.m... --- TYPICAL TASKS - "Find and list all the duplicate files inside ~/Documents/" - "Check my essay Final.docx for spelling, syntax or factual errors while maintaining the tone" - "Refactor my test_database.ts suite to be more concise" - "Try and find out why my computer is slow" - "Create a dockerized BlackSheep webapp with a test suite, then build the image and run it locally" --- So it's a coding assistant? You can use Solveig for analyzing, editing and testing your code, and all of these scenarios have received significant support through development features like code linting. But I didn't build Solveig with a single kind of use case in mind. --- So it's yet another LLM-in-my-terminal? Sort of. Solveig tries to do a few things that other tools don't, and to do the shared features with clearer UX, explicit consent, and deeper configuration. It's not an IDE extension, doesn't require a GUI, and it's not built for a specific user type or scenario. At the same time, Solveig's competitors are mature projects with real user testing that you should check out. I've written a detailed comparison (https://github.com/FSilveiraa/solveig/blob/main/docs/compari...) to similar tools in the market in the docs. --- UPCOMING I have a Roadmap (https://github.com/FSilveiraa/solveig/discussions/2) available, and feel free to suggest new features or improvements. I've recently added user-defined system prompt templates, and now I'm working on adding token counting from API messages instead of relying on encoders. --- A cool aspect of this project is that I can use Solveig to analyze and improve its own code itself, which also gives me a lot of exposure to its actual usability. I appreciate any feedback or comment, especially anyone who can try out Solveig using Anthropic or Gemini APIs. Tell me if it helped you do something or what stopped you from using it properly in your specific case. Even if you can't see how Solveig could help you let me know, that's an issue with me communicating value that I need to fix. Leaving a star on the repository (https://github.com/FSilveiraa/solveig) is also very much appreciated. Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45918584 Points: 1 # Comments: 0

### 5. Active Directory Under Siege: Why Critical Infrastructure Needs Stronger Security

**Summary:** Active Directory remains the authentication backbone for over 90% of Fortune 1000 companies. AD's importance has grown as companies adopt hybrid and cloud infrastructure, but so has its complexity. Every application, user, and device traces back to AD for authentication and authorization, making it the ultimate target. For attackers, it represents the holy grail: compromise Active

## Schneier on Security

### 1. Book Review: The Business of Secrets

**Link:** [https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/11/book-review-the-business-of-secrets.html](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/11/book-review-the-business-of-secrets.html)

**Published:** 11/13/2025

**Summary:** The Business of Secrets: Adventures in Selling Encryption Around the World by Fred Kinch (May 24, 2004) From the vantage point of today, it’s surreal reading about the commercial cryptography business in the 1970s. Nobody knew anything. The manufacturers didn’t know whether the cryptography they sold was any good. The customers didn’t know whether the crypto they bought was any good. Everyone pretended to know, thought they knew, or knew better than to even try to know. The Business of Secrets is the self-published memoirs of Fred Kinch. He was founder and vice president of—mostly sales—at a US cryptographic hardware company called Datotek, from company’s founding in 1969 until 1982. It’s mostly a disjointed collection of stories about the difficulties of selling to governments worldwide, along with descriptions of the highs and (mostly) lows of foreign airlines, foreign hotels, and foreign travel in general. But it’s also about encryption...

### 2. On Hacking Back

**Link:** [https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/11/on-hacking-back.html](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/11/on-hacking-back.html)

**Published:** 11/12/2025

**Summary:** Former DoJ attorney John Carlin writes about hackback, which he defines thus: “A hack back is a type of cyber response that incorporates a counterattack designed to proactively engage with, disable, or collect evidence about an attacker. Although hack backs can take on various forms, they are—­by definition­—not passive defensive measures.” His conclusion: As the law currently stands, specific forms of purely defense measures are authorized so long as they affect only the victim’s system or data. At the other end of the spectrum, offensive measures that involve accessing or otherwise causing damage or loss to the hacker’s systems are likely prohibited, absent government oversight or authorization. And even then parties should proceed with caution in light of the heightened risks of misattribution, collateral damage, and retaliation...

**Published:** 11/12/2025

**Summary:** In national security and defense, air-gapped networks remain the gold standard for protecting mission-critical systems. By physically isolating networks from external connectivity, they're protected against remote intrusion, espionage, and supply chain compromise. For programs that operate under DoD Impact Level 6 (IL6), NATO Secret, GEHEIM, or similar constraints, this isolation is non-negotiable.
