### 1. Tell HN: ChatGPT has 13B revenue but can't make a working website

**Summary:** People talk a lot about AI being really great. But can OpenAI use it to make their own website work? The ChatGPT performance is terrible, and has been for months. I use ChatGPT on both a Mac M3 w/32GB RAM, and a AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 7840U (w/ Radeon 780M) & 32GB RAM. After I have been using a single ChatGPT page/thread/whatever to do research for a day or two, it becomes insanely slow, locking up the browser for minutes at a time. The only recourse is to stop the page, kill the tab, and re-open the page, and hope ChatGPT is done doing whatever is locking things up. So I end up literally "exporting to JSON" whatever i've done, and opening a new thread, pasting the JSON there, just so I can continue my research/planning. Example screenshot (where it's locking up even while trying to file a bug report): https://imgur.com/a/JfEXocr I have reported this same bug for months. There is no indication anyone has seen these reports or is working on it, no customer service or feedback. It's like putting a letter in a bottle and tossing it out to sea. Forget the potential impact to the environment, the economy, to jobs, the world, etc. The thing that pisses me off the most about AI is how hard is it to make a website that doesn't lock up the browser?! Like what exactly is their web page even doing that it has to suck up this many resources? I'm not doing 3d rendering here! I just need it to show me text for god's sake! This is the opposite of rocket science, and yet these bozos can't get this right? Why would anyone trust them with anything important?

**Link:** [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46098795](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46098795)

**Published:** 11/30/2025

**Summary:** I’ve started working on Schema Pilot, an open-source idea for a visual database designer that generates Prisma schema + SQL automatically from a drag-and-drop interface. Right now it’s very early — mostly the landing page + initial planning for the core engine. But the vision is: visually create tables & relations auto-generate FK logic export clean Prisma + SQL eventually import existing Prisma schemas I'm building it in the open and would love feedback, contributors, or anyone interested in the problem space.
