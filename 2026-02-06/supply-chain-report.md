### 1. Show HN: Null0 – AI Clone; Open-source CLI that gives AI your personal context

**Link:** [https://github.com/amaar-mc/null0-cli](https://github.com/amaar-mc/null0-cli)

**Published:** 2/6/2026

**Summary:** null0 stores your personal context, and the goal is to have it inject relevant context automatically into Claude, Codex, Gemini, or even OpenClaw. I built null0 because I got tired of re-explaining myself to every AI session. My preferences, my tech stack, how I think, how I write -- gone every time the context window resets. The goal is to create an actual AI clone that predicts your intent. Imagine a future where you open your laptop and your AI Jarvis already knows what you will likely want to do based on all of the context it has. This could act as a central data provider once users’ have used it enough, enabling hyper-personalized experiences based on your custom persona and individualistic traits. I have a big vision for this. It's similar to OpenClaw in the sense that it's simply using your Codex, Claude Code, or Gemini API key / accounts, meaning there is no additional cost. If using Gemini, I use Cognee for the vector search. I am trying to stay away from RAG and instead switch to document header encoding.

### 1. AgentOps Is Here: What DevSecOps Leaders Need to Do Now

**Link:** [https://www.sonatype.com/blog/agentops-is-here-what-devsecops-leaders-need-to-do-now](https://www.sonatype.com/blog/agentops-is-here-what-devsecops-leaders-need-to-do-now)

**Published:** 2/5/2026

**Summary:** We've seen this pattern before. The industry gets a new kind of leverage, treats it like a tool upgrade, and then acts surprised when the operating model snaps under the strain. Waterfall didn't "become" Agile because of Jira. DevOps didn't "become" DevSecOps because someone added a scanner to CI. Those shifts worked because teams changed how decisions were made, who was accountable for what, and how alignment held when the pace increased.

**Published:** 2/5/2026

**Summary:** Hackers associated with the Chinese government used a Trojaned version of Notepad++ to deliver malware to selected users. Notepad++ said that officials with the unnamed provider hosting the update infrastructure consulted with incident responders and found that it remained compromised until September 2. Even then, the attackers maintained credentials to the internal services until December 2, a capability that allowed them to continue redirecting selected update traffic to malicious servers. The threat actor “specifically targeted Notepad++ domain with the goal of exploiting insufficient update verification controls that existed in older versions of Notepad++.” Event logs indicate that the hackers tried to re-exploit one of the weaknesses after it was fixed but that the attempt failed...
