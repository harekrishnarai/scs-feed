**Link:** [https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/threatsday-bulletin-dns-poisoning-flaw.html](https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/threatsday-bulletin-dns-poisoning-flaw.html)

**Published:** 10/30/2025

**Summary:** The comfort zone in cybersecurity is gone. Attackers are scaling down, focusing tighter, and squeezing more value from fewer, high-impact targets. At the same time, defenders face growing blind spots — from spoofed messages to large-scale social engineering. This week’s findings show how that shrinking margin of safety is redrawing the threat landscape. Here’s what’s

### 1. Offline, Not Off-Guard: Countering Software Supply Chain Threats in High-Security Environments

**Link:** [https://www.sonatype.com/blog/offline-not-off-guard-countering-software-supply-chain-threats-in-high-security-environments](https://www.sonatype.com/blog/offline-not-off-guard-countering-software-supply-chain-threats-in-high-security-environments)

**Published:** 10/30/2025

**Summary:** For decades, federal programs operating in high-security or classified domains have relied on air-gapped environments as a primary line of defense. The simple logic being that if networks are physically isolated from the public internet, they can't be attacked from the outside. But, in today's evolving cybersecurity landscape, this assumption of safety through isolation no longer holds.

### 1. 10 Leading Software Composition Analysis Tools for DevSecOps Teams

**Link:** [https://www.kiuwan.com/blog/software-composition-analysis-tools/](https://www.kiuwan.com/blog/software-composition-analysis-tools/)

**Published:** 10/30/2025

**Summary:** Modern applications often rely on layers of open-source code, sometimes with hundreds of dependencies. While open-source components accelerate development, they can also introduce security, compliance, and maintenance risks if they aren’t continuously monitored and managed. Software composition analysis (SCA) tools help teams identify vulnerabilities, monitor component health, manage software licenses, and maintain compliance throughout the […]

### 1. The AI-Designed Bioweapon Arms Race

**Link:** [https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/10/the-ai-designed-bioweapon-arms-race.html](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/10/the-ai-designed-bioweapon-arms-race.html)

**Published:** 10/30/2025

**Summary:** Interesting article about the arms race between AI systems that invent/design new biological pathogens, and AI systems that detect them before they’re created: The team started with a basic test: use AI tools to design variants of the toxin ricin, then test them against the software that is used to screen DNA orders. The results of the test suggested there was a risk of dangerous protein variants slipping past existing screening software, so the situation was treated like the equivalent of a zero-day vulnerability. […] Details of that original test are ...

### 2. Signal’s Post-Quantum Cryptographic Implementation

**Link:** [https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/10/signals-post-quantum-cryptographic-implementation.html](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/10/signals-post-quantum-cryptographic-implementation.html)

**Published:** 10/29/2025

**Summary:** Signal has just rolled out its quantum-safe cryptographic implementation. Ars Technica has a really good article with details: Ultimately, the architects settled on a creative solution. Rather than bolt KEM onto the existing double ratchet, they allowed it to remain more or less the same as it had been. Then they used the new quantum-safe ratchet to implement a parallel secure messaging system. Now, when the protocol encrypts a message, it sources encryption keys from both the classic Double Ratchet and the new ratchet. It then mixes the two keys together (using a cryptographic key derivation function) to get a new encryption key that has all of the security of the classical Double Ratchet but now has quantum security, too...

### 1. Aisuru Botnet Shifts from DDoS to Residential Proxies

**Link:** [https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/aisuru-botnet-shifts-from-ddos-to-residential-proxies/](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/aisuru-botnet-shifts-from-ddos-to-residential-proxies/)

**Published:** 10/29/2025

**Summary:** Aisuru, the botnet responsible for a series of record-smashing distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks this year, recently was overhauled to support a more low-key, lucrative and sustainable business: Renting hundreds of thousands of infected Internet of Things (IoT) devices to proxy services that help cybercriminals anonymize their traffic. Experts says a glut of proxies from Aisuru and other sources is fueling large-scale data harvesting efforts tied to various artificial intelligence (AI) projects, helping content scrapers evade detection by routing their traffic through residential connections that appear to be regular Internet users.
