### 3. Show HN: Modeling the Human Body in Rust So I Can Cmd+Click Through It

**Published:** 10/10/2025

**Summary:** I started this trying to understand two things: why my Asian friends turn red after drinking, and why several friends all seemed to have migraine clusters. I was reading medical papers and textbooks, but kept getting lost jumping between topics. I thought: what if I could just Cmd+Click through this like code? What if "ALDH2 gene" was actually clickable, and took me to the variant, the phenotype, the population frequencies? So I started modeling human biology in Rust with my Ralph agent (Claude in a loop, ty ghuntley). Turns out the type system is perfect for this. Every biological entity is strongly-typed with relationships enforced at compile time. After 1 day of agent coding: - 277 Rust files, ~95k lines of code  - 1,561 tests passing - 13 complete organ systems - Genetics with ancestry-specific variants - Clinical pathology models Try it: git clone https://github.com/lantos1618/open_human_ontology cd open_human_ontology cargo run --example ide_navigation_demo Then open `examples/ide_navigation_demo.rs` and Cmd+Click through: Understanding Asian flush: AsianGeneticVariantsCatalog::get_metabolic_variants() // Click through to: // → ALDH2 gene on chromosome 12q24.12 // → rs671 variant (Glu504Lys) // → 40% frequency in Japanese population // → Alcohol flush reaction // → 10x esophageal cancer risk with alcohol // → Acetaldehyde metabolism pathway Understanding migraines: Migraine {     subtype: WithAura,     triggers: [Stress, LackOfSleep, HormonalChanges],     genetic_variants: ["rs2075968", "rs1835740"],     ... } // Click through to: // → 17 migraine trigger types // → 12 aura symptom types // → Genetic risk factors // → Why clusters happen (HormonalChanges → Menstruation) Now I can actually navigate the connections instead of flipping through PDFs. Heart → CoronaryArtery → Plaque. VisualCortex → 200M neurons → NeuralConnection pathways. It's like Wikipedia but type-checked and with jump-to-definition. This isn't production medical software - it's a learning tool. But it's way more useful than textbooks for understanding how biological systems connect. The agent keeps expanding it. Sometimes it OOMs but that's part of the fun. Tech: Rust, nalgebra, serde, rayon, proptest I am not a dr or medical professional this is for my education you can commit to it if you want to or review and open some PR's if you find wrong information or want to add references.

### 1. DDoS Botnet Aisuru Blankets US ISPs in Record DDoS

**Link:** [https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/ddos-botnet-aisuru-blankets-us-isps-in-record-ddos/](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/ddos-botnet-aisuru-blankets-us-isps-in-record-ddos/)

**Published:** 10/10/2025

**Summary:** The world's largest and most disruptive botnet is now drawing a majority of its firepower from compromised Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices hosted on U.S. Internet providers like AT&T, Comcast and Verizon, new evidence suggests. Experts say the heavy concentration of infected devices at U.S. providers is complicating efforts to limit collateral damage from the botnet's attacks, which shattered previous records this week with a brief traffic flood that clocked in at nearly 30 trillion bits of data per second.

**Published:** 10/10/2025

**Summary:** AI agents are now hacking computers. They’re getting better at all phases of cyberattacks, faster than most of us expected. They can chain together different aspects of a cyber operation, and hack autonomously, at computer speeds and scale. This is going to change everything. Over the summer, hackers proved the concept, industry institutionalized it, and criminals operationalized it. In June, AI company XBOW took the top spot on HackerOne’s US leaderboard after submitting over 1,000 new vulnerabilities in just a few months. In August, the seven teams competing in DARPA’s AI Cyber Challenge ...
