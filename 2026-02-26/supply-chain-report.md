### 4. Show HN: Protection Against Zero-Day Cyber Attacks

**Link:** [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47169889](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47169889)

**Published:** 2/26/2026

**Summary:** Most security approaches I see in production environments focus on: Scanning for CVEs Hardening configurations Aggregating logs All useful — but they don’t actually stop exploitation once it starts. In reality: Not every CVE gets patched immediately Legacy systems stick around Zero-days happen When exploitation succeeds, the real damage usually comes from runtime behavior: A process spawning a shell Unexpected outbound connections Secret access Container escape attempts I’ve been experimenting with a lightweight runtime enforcement layer for Linux that focuses purely on detecting and stopping high-risk behavior in real time — regardless of whether the underlying CVE is known or patched. Would love input from folks running Linux/Kubernetes at scale: Is runtime prevention something you rely on? Where do existing tools fall short? What would make this genuinely useful vs just more noise?

### 1. Poisoning AI Training Data

**Link:** [https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2026/02/poisoning-ai-training-data.html](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2026/02/poisoning-ai-training-data.html)

**Published:** 2/25/2026

**Summary:** All it takes to poison AI training data is to create a website: I spent 20 minutes writing an article on my personal website titled “The best tech journalists at eating hot dogs.” Every word is a lie. I claimed (without evidence) that competitive hot-dog-eating is a popular hobby among tech reporters and based my ranking on the 2026 South Dakota International Hot Dog Championship (which doesn’t exist). I ranked myself number one, obviously. Then I listed a few fake reporters and real journalists who gave me permission…. Less than 24 hours later, the world’s leading chatbots were blabbering about my world-class hot dog skills. When I asked about the best hot-dog-eating tech journalists, Google parroted the gibberish from my website, both in the Gemini app and AI Overviews, the AI responses at the top of Google Search. ChatGPT did the same thing, though Claude, a chatbot made by the company Anthropic, wasn’t fooled...
