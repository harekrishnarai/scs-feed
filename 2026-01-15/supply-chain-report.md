### 2. Show HN: Superhuman for LinkedIn Inbox

**Link:** [https://www.withtact.app/](https://www.withtact.app/)

**Published:** 1/15/2026

**Summary:** Hi HN, I built Tact, a keyboard-first client that sits on top of your LinkedIn inbox and makes outbound faster without turning it into AI-generated slop. The goal was to help people who do targeted, relationship-driven outreach move quickly while still writing every word themselves. Tact doesn’t ghostwrite messages or auto-send anything. Instead, it gives you speed, structure, and light AI coaching while you write. What it does today: - Keyboard-first LinkedIn inbox Navigate conversations, open threads, reply, and move between messages using shortcuts instead of clicking through LinkedIn’s UI. - Snippets + dynamic snippets Reusable sentence/paragraph blocks with variables (name, company, role, etc.) that you can drop in instantly and still edit freely. Dynamic snippets let you just describe the variable, and we'll generate using enriched data and web search. - Coaching instead of ghostwriting AI flags things like missing personalization, awkward phrasing, or placeholders you forgot to update, but it doesn’t generate full messages for you. It’s a thin layer focused purely on the act of writing and handling your LinkedIn inbox more deliberately. The mental model is closer to a power-user email client (Vim-style speed) than a "click a button and spray AI" tool. You can try it here: https://withtact.app I’d love feedback on: - Whether "coaching, not ghostwriting" is actually useful in practice - How the keyboard UX compares to native LinkedIn - What’s missing Happy to answer questions about implementation details or anything else.

**Link:** [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46636861](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46636861)

**Published:** 1/15/2026

**Summary:** Background: I manage an ecommerce website. Recent bot traffic is up. Most traffic can be traced to one or two IP addresses with hundreds of requests per day. These ip addresses don't have DNS records for reverse lookup, and when I map the requests in cloudflare, one address shows up as requesting from different data centers all over the US. What is going on here? Source IP example 173 . 245 . 58 . 0  Chicago, United States (ORD) 340 requests San Jose, United States (SJC) 330 requests Los Angeles, United States (LAX) 310 requests Atlanta, United States (ATL) 310 requests Dallas-Fort Worth, United States (DFW) 290 requests Newark, United States (EWR) 280 requests Washington, United States (IAD) 230 requests Miami, United States (MIA) 210 requests Boston, United States (BOS) 140 requests Singapore, Singapore (SIN) 130 requests Thanks for ideas.
