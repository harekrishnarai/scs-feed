### 1. Show HN: LinuxMate generates reproducible Linux setup script

**Link:** [https://github.com/Henkster72/LinuxMate](https://github.com/Henkster72/LinuxMate)

**Published:** 1/18/2026

**Summary:** I built *LinuxMate*, an open-source “Ninite for Linux” style tool: select common apps/tools, choose distro/package manager, and it outputs a reproducible post-install script. Motivation: the “first hour after install” is still weirdly manual. LinuxMate aims to turn that into a deterministic bootstrap step you can re-run or share. *Demo:* [https://www.allroundwebsite.com/linuxmate/](https://www.allroundwebsite.com/linuxmate/) *Repo:* [https://github.com/Henkster72/LinuxMate](https://github.com/Henkster72/LinuxMate) *Background / reasoning:* [https://www.allroundwebsite.com/blog/bye-windows-hello-linux...](https://www.allroundwebsite.com/blog/bye-windows-hello-linux...) Feedback welcome: distro targets, package selection, idempotency, security concerns (curl | bash etc.), and whether you’d prefer CLI/config-driven generation.

### 2. Show HN: HTTP:COLON – A quick HTTP header/directive inspector and reference

**Link:** [https://httpcolon.dev/](https://httpcolon.dev/)

**Published:** 1/18/2026

**Summary:** Hi HN -- I built HTTP:COLON, a small, open-source web tool for quickly checking a site’s HTTP response headers and learning what they mean as you go. Link: https://httpcolon.dev/ What it does - Enter a URL and fetch its response headers - Groups common headers into handy buckets (cache, content, security) - Includes short docs/tooltips for headers and directives so you can look things up while debugging. I find hovering on highlighted headers quite useful! Supports different HTTP methods (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE) Deep links - You can link directly to a host, e.g. https://httpcolon.dev/www.google.com  (or any domain) to jump straight into inspecting it. Why I made it - I kept bouncing between DevTools, MDN, and random blog posts while debugging caching + security headers. I wanted one place that’s quick for “what am I getting back?” and “what does this header/directive do?” It’s in beta, and I’d love feedback on: - Missing features you’d want for day-to-day debugging (export/share formats, comparisons, presets, etc.) Thanks!
