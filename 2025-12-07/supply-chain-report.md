**Published:** 12/7/2025

**Summary:** Hi HN — we built Sitekick to make it insanely easy for any website to get real-time chat, lead capture, and basic user support. In one line: install a couple of lines of code, and Sitekick gives you a chat widget + backend logic. What it does: Turns your site into a chat-ready platform: handle FAQs, answer visitor questions, capture leads, coordinate bookings or contact forms — automatically. Works across web and messaging/social channels (depending on integration) — so visitors get support wherever they prefer. Includes logic for qualifying leads and handing over to humans if needed. Why we built it: We’d seen too many sites lose visitors or leads because chat/support was too complex to set up or sporadic. Sitekick was built to close that gap: simple setup, always available, no dev-heavy integration required. We’d love feedback from the HN community — thoughts on use-cases, missing features, or ways to make it more open / developer-friendly. Thank you!
