### 3. Pyversity with Thomas van Dongen (Springer Nature)

**Link:** [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46195723](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46195723)

**Published:** 12/8/2025

**Summary:** I am SUPER EXCITED to publish the 132nd episode of the Weaviate Podcast with Thomas van Dongen, head of AI engineering at Springer Nature! Thomas is the creator of Pyversity, a fast, lightweight open-source python library for diversifying retrieval results! Diversity is such an underrated topic in AI and Vector Databases. Whether searching through e-Commerce products or Scientific papers, we often want serendipity from our search engine, results that we were not expecting to find! For example, say you ask "Who has accomplish the most in professional sports?". A relevance optimized search system might return 10 results all about Michale Jordan... whereas a diversity enhanced system would produce information about Michael Jordan, Tom Brady, Tiger Woods, ... Rather than just return the relevance ranked search results, Pyversity uses methods such as Maximal Marginal Relevnace (MMR) or Determinantal Point Process (DPP) to achieve diverse results. I learned a lot from this conversation exploring the general topic of diversity in vector spaces, diversification strategies from Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) to Determinantal point process (DPP), and more, as well as Thomas' work and thoughts on AI in Scientific Literature! I hope you find it interesting!

### 1. Substitution Cipher Based on The Voynich Manuscript

**Published:** 12/8/2025

**Summary:** Here’s a fun paper: “The Naibbe cipher: a substitution cipher that encrypts Latin and Italian as Voynich Manuscript-like ciphertext“: Abstract: In this article, I investigate the hypothesis that the Voynich Manuscript (MS 408, Yale University Beinecke Library) is compatible with being a ciphertext by attempting to develop a historically plausible cipher that can replicate the manuscript’s unusual properties. The resulting cipher­a verbose homophonic substitution cipher I call the Naibbe cipher­can be done entirely by hand with 15th-century materials, and when it encrypts a wide range of Latin and Italian plaintexts, the resulting ciphertexts remain fully decipherable and also reliably reproduce many key statistical properties of the Voynich Manuscript at once. My results suggest that the so-called “ciphertext hypothesis” for the Voynich Manuscript remains viable, while also placing constraints on plausible substitution cipher structures...
