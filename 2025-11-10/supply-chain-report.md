### 1. New Attacks Against Secure Enclaves

**Link:** [https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/11/new-attacks-against-secure-enclaves.html](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/11/new-attacks-against-secure-enclaves.html)

**Published:** 11/10/2025

**Summary:** Encryption can protect data at rest and data in transit, but does nothing for data in use. What we have are secure enclaves. I’ve written about this before: Almost all cloud services have to perform some computation on our data. Even the simplest storage provider has code to copy bytes from an internal storage system and deliver them to the user. End-to-end encryption is sufficient in such a narrow context. But often we want our cloud providers to be able to perform computation on our raw data: search, analysis, AI model training or fine-tuning, and more. Without expensive, esoteric techniques, such as secure multiparty computation protocols or homomorphic encryption techniques that can perform calculations on encrypted data, cloud servers require access to the unencrypted data to do anything useful...
