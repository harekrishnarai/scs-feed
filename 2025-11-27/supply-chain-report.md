### 3. Show HN: Hatch v1.16.0 – workspaces, dependency groups and SBOMs

**Link:** [https://hatch.pypa.io/1.16/blog/2025/11/24/hatch-v1160/](https://hatch.pypa.io/1.16/blog/2025/11/24/hatch-v1160/)

**Published:** 11/27/2025

**Summary:** This release wouldn’t have been possible without Cary, our new co-maintainer. He picked up my unfinished workspaces branch and made it production-ready, added SBOM support to Hatchling, and landed a bunch of PRs from contributors! My motivation took a big hit last year, in large part due to improper use of social media: I simply didn’t realize that continued mass evangelism is required nowadays. This led to some of our novel features being attributed to other tools when in fact Hatch was months ahead. I’m sorry to say that this greatly discouraged me and I let it affect maintenance. No more of that! Development will be much more rapid now, even better than the way it used to be. We are very excited for upcoming features :-) Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46071738 Points: 1 # Comments: 1
