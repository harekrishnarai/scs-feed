### 2. Show HN: SQL Query Optimizer

**Link:** [https://github.com/SubhanHakverdiyev/OptimizeQL/blob/main/README.md](https://github.com/SubhanHakverdiyev/OptimizeQL/blob/main/README.md)

**Published:** 2/20/2026

**Summary:** Hello all, I wrote a tool to optimize SQL queries using LLM models. I sometimes struggle to find the root cause for the slow running queries and sending to LLM most of the time doesn't have good result. I think the reason is LLM doesnt have the context of our database, schemas, explain results .etc. That is why I decided to write a tool that gathers all infor about our data and suggest meaningful improvements including adding indexes, materialized views, or simply rewriting the query itself. The tool supports only PostgreSQL and MySQL for now , but you can easily fork and add your own desired database. You just need to add your LLM api key and database credentials. It is an open source tool so I highly appreciate the review and contribution if you would like. Feel free to check it out : https://github.com/SubhanHakverdiyev/OptimizeQL Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47091806 Points: 1 # Comments: 0

### 3. Ask HN: What is the current adoption scenario for background coding agents?

**Link:** [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47091805](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47091805)

**Published:** 2/20/2026

**Summary:** Hi, background coding agents are here for about half a year now. But only bold and forward teams are using it so far. what is your say? have you adopted background agents in your organization or are most of the people still working with locally running coding agents? One thing i have felt is that organizations are reluctant to give access to these vendors to clone their repos in cloud machines. But what is the overall scenario? are we shifting really to background agents, if yes are organizations and teams trusting third party vendors to clone their repos on cloud machines for the agent to work on? Thanks! Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47091805 Points: 1 # Comments: 1

### 4. Show HN: Manifestinx-verify – offline verifier for evidence bundles (drift)

**Link:** [https://github.com/OneInX/Manifest-InX-EBS](https://github.com/OneInX/Manifest-InX-EBS)

**Published:** 2/20/2026

**Summary:** Manifest-InX EBS is a spec + offline verifier + proof kit for tamper-evident evidence bundles. Non-negotiable alignment: - Live provider calls are nondeterministic. - Determinism begins at CAPTURE (pinned artifacts). - Replay is deterministic offline. - Drift/tamper is deterministically rejected. Try it in typically ~10 minutes (no signup): 1) Run the verifier against the included golden bundle → PASS 2) Tamper an artifact without updating hashes → deterministic drift/tamper rejection Repo: https://github.com/OneInX/Manifest-InX-EBS Skeptic check: docs/ebs/PROOF_KIT/10_MINUTE_SKEPTIC_CHECK.md Exit codes: 0=OK, 2=DRIFT/TAMPER, 1=INVALID/ERROR Boundaries: - This repo ships verifier/spec/proof kit only. The Evidence Gateway (capture/emission runtime) is intentionally not included. - This is not a “model correctness / no hallucinations” claim—this is evidence integrity + deterministic replay/verification from pinned artifacts. Looking for feedback: - Does the exit-code model map cleanly to CI gate usage? - Any spec/report format rough edges that block adoption?

**Summary:** With one in three cyber-attacks now involving compromised employee accounts, insurers and regulators are placing far greater emphasis on identity posture when assessing cyber risk.  For many organizations, however, these assessments remain largely opaque. Elements such as password hygiene, privileged access management, and the extent of multi-factor authentication (MFA) coverage are
