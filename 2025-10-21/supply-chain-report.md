### 2. Agentic AI’s OODA Loop Problem

**Link:** [https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/10/agentic-ais-ooda-loop-problem.html](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/10/agentic-ais-ooda-loop-problem.html)

**Published:** 10/20/2025

**Summary:** The OODA loop—for observe, orient, decide, act—is a framework to understand decision-making in adversarial situations. We apply the same framework to artificial intelligence agents, who have to make their decisions with untrustworthy observations and orientation. To solve this problem, we need new systems of input, processing, and output integrity. Many decades ago, U.S. Air Force Colonel John Boyd introduced the concept of the “OODA loop,” for Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act. These are the four steps of real-time continuous decision-making. Boyd developed it for fighter pilots, but it’s long been applied in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. An AI agent, like a pilot, executes the loop over and over, accomplishing its goals iteratively within an ever-changing environment. This is Anthropic’s definition: “Agents are models using tools in a loop.”...
