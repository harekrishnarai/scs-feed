### 3. Show HN: A kids' math app without dark patterns

**Link:** [https://playlumi.app/](https://playlumi.app/)

**Published:** 1/14/2026

**Summary:** I wanted to find an iPad game where my 5yo could learn math, which sounded simple. Turns out most kids' educational apps are... shady. Notifications, streak mechanics, ads for games definitely not meant for children, coin systems and flashy rewards designed to maximize engagement rather than learning. So I decided to vibe code something for her. The result is Lumi. It's a simple math app with: - No ads, no accounts, no tracking - No notifications  - No coins, streaks, or variable reward nonsense - Daily limits (because kids should go play outside) - Works offline, stores everything locally - Supports English, Portuguese, German, French (more to come) My daughter has been using it for a while now and actually enjoys it. The problems adapt to her level, and when she hits the daily limit, it just tells her to go do something else. It's completely free and open source. I built it for her, but figured other parents might find it useful too. https://playlumi.app/ https://github.com/matheusml/lumi Happy to answer questions about the tech stack (SvelteKit, TypeScript), decisions, or anything else Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46620215 Points: 1 # Comments: 0

**Published:** 1/13/2026

**Summary:** Forty years ago, The Mentor—Loyd Blankenship—published “The Conscience of a Hacker” in Phrack. You bet your ass we’re all alike… we’ve been spoon-fed baby food at school when we hungered for steak… the bits of meat that you did let slip through were pre-chewed and tasteless.  We’ve been dominated by sadists, or ignored by the apathetic.  The few that had something to teach found us willing pupils, but those few are like drops of water in the desert. This is our world now… the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud.  We make use of a service already existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn’t run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals.  We explore… and you call us criminals.  We seek after knowledge… and you call us criminals.  We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias… and you call us criminals. You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it’s for our own good, yet we’re the criminals...
