### 3. Show HN: I'm building an open-source Amazon

**Link:** [https://openship.org](https://openship.org)

**Published:** 12/12/2025

**Summary:** I'm building an open source Amazon. In other words, an open source decentralized marketplace. But like Carl Sagan said, to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe. So first I had to make open source management systems for every vertical. I'm launching the first one today, Openfront e-commerce, an open source Shopify alternative. Next will be Openfront restaurant, Openfront grocery, and Openfront gym. And all of these Openfronts will connect to our decentralized marketplace, "the/marketplace", seamlessly. Once we launch other Openfronts, you'll be able to do everything from booking hotels to ordering groceries right from one place with no middle men. The marketplace simply connects to the Openfront just like its built-in storefront does. Together, we can use open source to disrupt marketplaces and make sure sellers, in every vertical, are never beholden to them.

### 4. Ask HN: Who is honestly evaluating AI outputs and how?

**Link:** [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46246932](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46246932)

**Published:** 12/12/2025

**Summary:** Especially with multimodal AI conversations, evaluating and benchmarking these models is an increasingly complex topic, but a frustrating interaction with AI can really leave customers feeling sour about your whole product / service. For an in-product AI assistant (with grounding, doc retrieval, and tool calling) I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around how to evaluate and monitor its success with customer interactions, prompt adherence, correctness and appropriateness, etc. Any tips or resources that have been helpful to folks investing this challenge? Would love to learn. What does your stack / process look like? Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46246932 Points: 1 # Comments: 0

### 1. Building Trustworthy AI Agents

**Link:** [https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/12/building-trustworthy-ai-agents.html](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/12/building-trustworthy-ai-agents.html)

**Published:** 12/12/2025

**Summary:** The promise of personal AI assistants rests on a dangerous assumption: that we can trust systems we haven’t made trustworthy. We can’t. And today’s versions are failing us in predictable ways: pushing us to do things against our own best interests, gaslighting us with doubt about things we are or that we know, and being unable to distinguish between who we are and who we have been. They struggle with incomplete, inaccurate, and partial context: with no standard way to move toward accuracy, no mechanism to correct sources of error, and no accountability when wrong information leads to bad decisions...

### 2. AIs Exploiting Smart Contracts

**Link:** [https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/12/ais-exploiting-smart-contracts.html](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/12/ais-exploiting-smart-contracts.html)

**Published:** 12/11/2025

**Summary:** I have long maintained that smart contracts are a dumb idea: that a human process is actually a security feature. Here’s some interesting research on training AIs to automatically exploit smart contracts: AI models are increasingly good at cyber tasks, as we’ve written about before. But what is the economic impact of these capabilities? In a recent MATS and Anthropic Fellows project, our scholars investigated this question by evaluating AI agents’ ability to exploit smart contracts on Smart CONtracts Exploitation benchmark (SCONE-bench)­a new benchmark they built comprising 405 contracts that were actually exploited between 2020 and 2025. On contracts exploited after the latest knowledge cutoffs (June 2025 for Opus 4.5 and March 2025 for other models), Claude Opus 4.5, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and GPT-5 developed exploits collectively worth $4.6 million, establishing a concrete lower bound for the economic harm these capabilities could enable. Going beyond retrospective analysis, we evaluated both Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5 in simulation against 2,849 recently deployed contracts without any known vulnerabilities. Both agents uncovered two novel zero-day vulnerabilities and produced exploits worth $3,694, with GPT-5 doing so at an API cost of $3,476. This demonstrates as a proof-of-concept that profitable, real-world autonomous exploitation is technically feasible, a finding that underscores the need for proactive adoption of AI for defense...
