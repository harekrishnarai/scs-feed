**Published:** 11/21/2025

**Summary:** Hi HN, I open-sourced this configuration generator because we wanted to have a version-controlled way to generate configuration files for our cell-based deployment. You can generate config files for any number of cells based on any schema. You can also nest your configuration to include different things like AWS account then cell name. Please let me know what you think! Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46007213 Points: 1 # Comments: 0

### 3. Show HN: Notedis a Feedback Widget for Freelancers Tired of Enterprise Pricing

**Link:** [https://notedis.com](https://notedis.com)

**Published:** 11/21/2025

**Summary:** I built Notedis - a visual feedback widget that captures annotated screenshots plus the technical context I need to debug (browser info, device details, screen resolution). Clients don't need to login or learn anything new. They click the widget, draw on what's wrong, and I can fix things much quicker with context. $20/month flat. Unlimited sites, unlimited feedback. No seats, no tiers. I kept it deliberately simple - three components: widget, dashboard, email replies. No Slack integrations, no AI features, no roadmap to enterprise. Just the core workflow that actually saves me time. Try out a free trial and let me know how I can improve it please!
