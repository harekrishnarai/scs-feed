### 1. Show HN: I curated 130 US PDF forms and made them fillable in browser

**Link:** [https://simplepdf.com/forms](https://simplepdf.com/forms)

**Published:** 2/17/2026

**Summary:** Hi HN! I built SimplePDF 7 years ago, with the vision from day one to help get rid of bureaucracy (I'm from France, I know what I'm talking about) Fast forward to this week where I finally released something I had on my mind for a long time: a repository of the main US forms that are ready to be filled, straight from the browser, as opposed to having to find a PDF tool online (or local). I focused on healthcare, ED, HR, Legal and IRS/Tax for now. On the tech-side, it's SimplePDF all the way down: client-side processing (the data / documents stay in your browser). I hope you find the resource useful! NiP Comments URL: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47051156 Points: 2 # Comments: 0

### 4. Webinar: How Modern SOC Teams Use AI and Context to Investigate Cloud Breaches Faster

**Link:** [https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/cloud-forensics-webinar-learn-how-ai.html](https://thehackernews.com/2026/02/cloud-forensics-webinar-learn-how-ai.html)

**Published:** 2/17/2026

**Summary:** Cloud attacks move fast — faster than most incident response teams. In data centers, investigations had time. Teams could collect disk images, review logs, and build timelines over days. In the cloud, infrastructure is short-lived. A compromised instance can disappear in minutes. Identities rotate. Logs expire. Evidence can vanish before analysis even begins. Cloud forensics is fundamentally

**Published:** 2/17/2026

**Summary:** As federal systems continue to underpin mission execution, software supply chain security has moved from a technical concern to a leadership responsibility. In 2026, the ability to understand, manage, and defend software risk directly influences whether programs can deliver capability at speed. Yet, we still see systemic weaknesses in how software trust is established.

### 1. SAST vs. SCA: Understanding the Key Differences in Code Security Testing

**Link:** [https://www.kiuwan.com/blog/sast-vs-sca/](https://www.kiuwan.com/blog/sast-vs-sca/)

**Published:** 2/17/2026

**Summary:** Modern application security depends on understanding what’s in your code, both the source code you write, and the third-party components you rely on. As software development accelerates and organizations adopt DevSecOps practices, teams face rising pressure to detect security vulnerabilities earlier in the software development lifecycle and strengthen their overall supply chain security posture. Most […]

### 1. Side-Channel Attacks Against LLMs

**Link:** [https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2026/02/side-channel-attacks-against-llms.html](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2026/02/side-channel-attacks-against-llms.html)

**Published:** 2/17/2026

**Summary:** Here are three papers describing different side-channel attacks against LLMs. “Remote Timing Attacks on Efficient Language Model Inference“: Abstract: Scaling up language models has significantly increased their capabilities. But larger models are slower models, and so there is now an extensive body of work (e.g., speculative sampling or parallel decoding) that improves the (average case) efficiency of language model generation. But these techniques introduce data-dependent timing characteristics. We show it is possible to exploit these timing differences to mount a timing attack. By monitoring the (encrypted) network traffic between a victim user and a remote language model, we can learn information about the content of messages by noting when responses are faster or slower. With complete black-box access, on open source systems we show how it is possible to learn the topic of a user’s conversation (e.g., medical advice vs. coding assistance) with 90%+ precision, and on production systems like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Anthropic’s Claude we can distinguish between specific messages or infer the user’s language. We further show that an active adversary can leverage a boosting attack to recover PII placed in messages (e.g., phone numbers or credit card numbers) for open source systems. We conclude with potential defenses and directions for future work...

### 1. Vulnerability or Not a Vulnerability?

**Link:** [https://jfrog.com/blog/vulnerability-or-not-a-vulnerability/](https://jfrog.com/blog/vulnerability-or-not-a-vulnerability/)

**Published:** 2/16/2026

**Summary:** Disputed CVEs: It’s Not a Bug, It’s a Debate Every CVE starts as a vulnerability claim, but not every claim ends in agreement. Between researchers racing to disclose vulnerabilities, and open-source maintainers guarding the stability and reputation of their projects, a gray zone appears where “vulnerability” becomes a matter of debate. This is the story …
