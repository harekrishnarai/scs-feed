### 3. Ask HN: How do you handle logging and evaluation when training ML models?

**Link:** [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45929871](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45929871)

**Published:** 11/14/2025

**Summary:** Hi all, I'm currently in a few ML classes and, while they do a great job covering theory, they don't cover application. At least not past some basic implementations in a Jupyter Notebook. One friction point I keep running into is how to handle logging and evaluation of the models. Right now I'm using Jupyter Notebook, I'll train the model, then produce a few graphs for different metrics with the test set. This whole workflow seems to be the standard among the folks in my program but I can't shake the feeling that it seems vibes-based and sub optimal. I've got a few projects coming up and I want to use them as a chance to improve my approach to training models. What method works for you? Are there any articles or libraries that you would recommend? What do you wish Jr. Engineers new about this? Thanks!

**Published:** 11/13/2025

**Summary:** The Business of Secrets: Adventures in Selling Encryption Around the World by Fred Kinch (May 24, 2024) From the vantage point of today, it’s surreal reading about the commercial cryptography business in the 1970s. Nobody knew anything. The manufacturers didn’t know whether the cryptography they sold was any good. The customers didn’t know whether the crypto they bought was any good. Everyone pretended to know, thought they knew, or knew better than to even try to know. The Business of Secrets is the self-published memoirs of Fred Kinch. He was founder and vice president of—mostly sales—at a US cryptographic hardware company called Datotek, from company’s founding in 1969 until 1982. It’s mostly a disjointed collection of stories about the difficulties of selling to governments worldwide, along with descriptions of the highs and (mostly) lows of foreign airlines, foreign hotels, and foreign travel in general. But it’s also about encryption...
